(ns jdk.util.SplittableRandom
  "A generator of uniform pseudorandom values applicable for use in
  (among other contexts) isolated parallel computations that may
  generate subtasks. Class SplittableRandom supports methods for
  producing pseudorandom numbers of type int, long,
  and double with similar usages as for class
  Random but differs in the following ways:



  Series of generated values pass the DieHarder suite testing
  independence and uniformity properties of random number generators.
  (Most recently validated with  version
  3.31.1.) These tests validate only the methods for certain
  types and ranges, but similar properties are expected to hold, at
  least approximately, for others as well. The period
  (length of any series of generated values before it repeats) is at
  least 264.

   Method split() constructs and returns a new
  SplittableRandom instance that shares no mutable state with the
  current instance. However, with very high probability, the
  values collectively generated by the two objects have the same
  statistical properties as if the same quantity of values were
  generated by a single thread using a single SplittableRandom object.

  Instances of SplittableRandom are not thread-safe.
  They are designed to be split, not shared, across threads. For
  example, a fork/join-style computation using random numbers might include a
  construction of the form new
  Subtask(aSplittableRandom.split()).fork().

  This class provides additional methods for generating random
  streams, that employ the above techniques when used in stream.parallel() mode.



  Instances of SplittableRandom are not cryptographically
  secure.  Consider instead using SecureRandom
  in security-sensitive applications. Additionally,
  default-constructed instances do not use a cryptographically random
  seed unless the system property
  java.util.secureRandomSeed is set to true."
