(ns jdk.beans.PropertyChangeSupport
  "This is a utility class that can be used by beans that support bound
  properties.  It manages a list of listeners and dispatches
  PropertyChangeEvents to them.  You can use an instance of this class
  as a member field of your bean and delegate these types of work to it.
  The PropertyChangeListener can be registered for all properties
  or for a property specified by name.

  Here is an example of PropertyChangeSupport usage that follows
  the rules and recommendations laid out in the JavaBeansâ„¢ specification:


  public class MyBean {
      private final PropertyChangeSupport pcs = new PropertyChangeSupport(this);

      public void addPropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener) {
          this.pcs.addPropertyChangeListener(listener);
      }

      public void removePropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener) {
          this.pcs.removePropertyChangeListener(listener);
      }

      private String value;

      public String getValue() {
          return this.value;
      }

      public void setValue(String newValue) {
          String oldValue = this.value;
          this.value = newValue;
          this.pcs.firePropertyChange(`value`, oldValue, newValue);
      }

      [...]
  }

  A PropertyChangeSupport instance is thread-safe.

  This class is serializable.  When it is serialized it will save
  (and restore) any listeners that are themselves serializable.  Any
  non-serializable listeners will be skipped during serialization."
