  " This interface is intended to be implemented by, or delegated from, instances

  of java.beans.beancontext.BeanContextChild instances, the current \"designTime\" property.

  The JavaBeansâ„¢ specification defines the notion of design time as is a
  mode in which JavaBeans instances should function during their composition
  and customization in a interactive design, composition or construction tool,
  as opposed to runtime when the JavaBean is part of an applet, application,
  or other live Java executable abstraction."
