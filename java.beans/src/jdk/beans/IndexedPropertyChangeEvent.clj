(ns jdk.beans.IndexedPropertyChangeEvent
  "An \"IndexedPropertyChange\" event gets delivered whenever a component that
  conforms to the JavaBeansâ„¢ specification (a \"bean\") changes a bound
  indexed property. This class is an extension of PropertyChangeEvent
  but contains the index of the property that has changed.

  Null values may be provided for the old and the new values if their
  true values are not known.

  An event source may send a null object as the name to indicate that an
  arbitrary set of if its properties have changed.  In this case the
  old and new values should also be null."
