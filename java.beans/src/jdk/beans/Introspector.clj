(ns jdk.beans.Introspector
  "The Introspector class provides a standard way for tools to learn about
  the properties, events, and methods supported by a target Java Bean.

  For each of those three kinds of information, the Introspector will
  separately analyze the bean's class and superclasses looking for
  either explicit or implicit information and use that information to
  build a BeanInfo object that comprehensively describes the target bean.

  For each class `Foo`, explicit information may be available if there exists
  a corresponding `FooBeanInfo` class that provides a non-null value when
  queried for the information.   We first look for the BeanInfo class by
  taking the full package-qualified name of the target bean class and
  appending `BeanInfo` to form a new class name.  If this fails, then
  we take the final classname component of this name, and look for that
  class in each of the packages specified in the BeanInfo package search
  path.

  Thus for a class such as `sun.xyz.OurButton` we would first look for a
  BeanInfo class called `sun.xyz.OurButtonBeanInfo` and if that failed we'd
  look in each package in the BeanInfo search path for an OurButtonBeanInfo
  class.  With the default search path, this would mean looking for
  `sun.beans.infos.OurButtonBeanInfo`.

  If a class provides explicit BeanInfo about itself then we add that to
  the BeanInfo information we obtained from analyzing any derived classes,
  but we regard the explicit information as being definitive for the current
  class and its base classes, and do not proceed any further up the superclass
  chain.

  If we don't find explicit BeanInfo on a class, we use low-level
  reflection to study the methods of the class and apply standard design
  patterns to identify property accessors, event sources, or public
  methods.  We then proceed to analyze the class's superclass and add
  in the information from it (and possibly on up the superclass chain).

  For more information about introspection and design patterns, please
  consult the
   JavaBeansâ„¢ specification."
