(ns jdk.text.Normalizer
  "This class provides the method normalize which transforms Unicode
  text into an equivalent composed or decomposed form, allowing for easier
  sorting and searching of text.
  The normalize method supports the standard normalization forms
  described in

  Unicode Standard Annex #15 â€” Unicode Normalization Forms.

  Characters with accents or other adornments can be encoded in
  several different ways in Unicode.  For example, take the character A-acute.
  In Unicode, this can be encoded as a single character (the `composed` form):



       U+00C1    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACUTE

  or as two separate characters (the `decomposed` form):



       U+0041    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A
       U+0301    COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT

  To a user of your program, however, both of these sequences should be
  treated as the same `user-level` character `A with acute accent`.  When you
  are searching or comparing text, you must ensure that these two sequences are
  treated as equivalent.  In addition, you must handle characters with more than
  one accent. Sometimes the order of a character's combining accents is
  significant, while in other cases accent sequences in different orders are
  really equivalent.

  Similarly, the string `ffi` can be encoded as three separate letters:



       U+0066    LATIN SMALL LETTER F
       U+0066    LATIN SMALL LETTER F
       U+0069    LATIN SMALL LETTER I

  or as the single character



       U+FB03    LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI

  The ffi ligature is not a distinct semantic character, and strictly speaking
  it shouldn't be in Unicode at all, but it was included for compatibility
  with existing character sets that already provided it.  The Unicode standard
  identifies such characters by giving them `compatibility` decompositions
  into the corresponding semantic characters.  When sorting and searching, you
  will often want to use these mappings.

  The normalize method helps solve these problems by transforming
  text into the canonical composed and decomposed forms as shown in the first
  example above. In addition, you can have it perform compatibility
  decompositions so that you can treat compatibility characters the same as
  their equivalents.
  Finally, the normalize method rearranges accents into the
  proper canonical order, so that you do not have to worry about accent
  rearrangement on your own.

  The W3C generally recommends to exchange texts in NFC.
  Note also that most legacy character encodings use only precomposed forms and
  often do not encode any combining marks by themselves. For conversion to such
  character encodings the Unicode text needs to be normalized to NFC.
  For more usage examples, see the Unicode Standard Annex."
