(ns jdk.text.Bidi
  "This class implements the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.

  A Bidi object provides information on the bidirectional reordering of the text
  used to create it.  This is required, for example, to properly display Arabic
  or Hebrew text.  These languages are inherently mixed directional, as they order
  numbers from left-to-right while ordering most other text from right-to-left.

  Once created, a Bidi object can be queried to see if the text it represents is
  all left-to-right or all right-to-left.  Such objects are very lightweight and
  this text is relatively easy to process.

  If there are multiple runs of text, information about the runs can be accessed
  by indexing to get the start, limit, and level of a run.  The level represents
  both the direction and the 'nesting level' of a directional run.  Odd levels
  are right-to-left, while even levels are left-to-right.  So for example level
  0 represents left-to-right text, while level 1 represents right-to-left text, and
  level 2 represents left-to-right text embedded in a right-to-left run."

(defn ->bidi
  "Constructor.

  Create Bidi from the given text, embedding, and direction information.
   The embeddings array may be null.  If present, the values represent embedding level
   information.  Negative values from -1 to -61 indicate overrides at the absolute value
   of the level.  Positive values from 1 to 61 indicate embeddings.  Where values are
   zero, the base embedding level as determined by the base direction is assumed.

  text - an array containing the paragraph of text to process. - `char[]`
  text-start - the index into the text array of the start of the paragraph. - `int`
  embeddings - an array containing embedding values for each character in the paragraph. This can be null, in which case it is assumed that there is no external embedding information. - `byte[]`
  emb-start - the index into the embedding array of the start of the paragraph. - `int`
  paragraph-length - the length of the paragraph in the text and embeddings arrays. - `int`
  flags - a collection of flags that control the algorithm. The algorithm understands the flags DIRECTION_LEFT_TO_RIGHT, DIRECTION_RIGHT_TO_LEFT, DIRECTION_DEFAULT_LEFT_TO_RIGHT, and DIRECTION_DEFAULT_RIGHT_TO_LEFT. Other values are reserved. - `int`"
