(ns jdk.sql.Clob
  "The mapping in the Javaâ„¢ programming language
  for the SQL CLOB type.
  An SQL CLOB is a built-in type
  that stores a Character Large Object as a column value in a row of
  a database table.
  By default drivers implement a Clob object using an SQL
  locator(CLOB), which means that a Clob object
  contains a logical pointer to the SQL CLOB data rather than
  the data itself. A Clob object is valid for the duration
  of the transaction in which it was created.
  The Clob interface provides methods for getting the
  length of an SQL CLOB (Character Large Object) value,
  for materializing a CLOB value on the client, and for
  searching for a substring or CLOB object within a
  CLOB value.
  Methods in the interfaces ResultSet,
  CallableStatement, and PreparedStatement, such as
  getClob and setClob allow a programmer to
  access an SQL CLOB value.  In addition, this interface
  has methods for updating a CLOB value.

  All methods on the Clob interface must be fully implemented if the
  JDBC driver supports the data type."
