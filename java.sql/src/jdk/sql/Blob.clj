(ns jdk.sql.Blob
  "The representation (mapping) in
  the Javaâ„¢ programming
  language of an SQL
  BLOB value.  An SQL BLOB is a built-in type
  that stores a Binary Large Object as a column value in a row of
  a database table. By default drivers implement Blob using
  an SQL locator(BLOB), which means that a
  Blob object contains a logical pointer to the
  SQL BLOB data rather than the data itself.
  A Blob object is valid for the duration of the
  transaction in which is was created.

  Methods in the interfaces ResultSet,
  CallableStatement, and PreparedStatement, such as
  getBlob and setBlob allow a programmer to
  access an SQL BLOB value.
  The Blob interface provides methods for getting the
  length of an SQL BLOB (Binary Large Object) value,
  for materializing a BLOB value on the client, and for
  determining the position of a pattern of bytes within a
  BLOB value. In addition, this interface has methods for updating
  a BLOB value.

  All methods on the Blob interface must be fully implemented if the
  JDBC driver supports the data type."
