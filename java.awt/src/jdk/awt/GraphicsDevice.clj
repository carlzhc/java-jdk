(ns jdk.awt.GraphicsDevice
  "The GraphicsDevice class describes the graphics devices
  that might be available in a particular graphics environment.  These
  include screen and printer devices. Note that there can be many screens
  and many printers in an instance of GraphicsEnvironment. Each
  graphics device has one or more GraphicsConfiguration objects
  associated with it.  These objects specify the different configurations
  in which the GraphicsDevice can be used.

  In a multi-screen environment, the GraphicsConfiguration
  objects can be used to render components on multiple screens.  The
  following code sample demonstrates how to create a JFrame
  object for each GraphicsConfiguration on each screen
  device in the GraphicsEnvironment:


    GraphicsEnvironment ge = GraphicsEnvironment.
    getLocalGraphicsEnvironment();
    GraphicsDevice[] gs = ge.getScreenDevices();
    for (int j = 0; j < gs.length; j++) {
       GraphicsDevice gd = gs[j];
       GraphicsConfiguration[] gc =
       gd.getConfigurations();
       for (int i=0; i < gc.length; i++) {
          JFrame f = new
          JFrame(gs[j].getDefaultConfiguration());
          Canvas c = new Canvas(gc[i]);
          Rectangle gcBounds = gc[i].getBounds();
          int xoffs = gcBounds.x;
          int yoffs = gcBounds.y;
          f.getContentPane().add(c);
          f.setLocation((i*50)+xoffs, (i*60)+yoffs);
          f.show();
       }
    }

   The display mode must be one of the display modes returned by

  "Enter full-screen mode, or return to windowed mode.  The entered

   Exclusive mode implies:

   Windows cannot overlap the full-screen window.  All other application
   windows will always appear beneath the full-screen window in the Z-order.
   There can be only one full-screen window on a device at any time,
   so calling this method while there is an existing full-screen Window
   will cause the existing full-screen window to
   return to windowed mode.
   Input method windows are disabled.  It is advisable to call
   Component.enableInputMethods(false) to make a component
   a non-client of the input method framework.


   The simulated full-screen mode places and resizes the window to the maximum
   possible visible area of the screen. However, the native windowing system
   may modify the requested geometry-related data, so that the Window object
   is placed and sized in a way that corresponds closely to the desktop settings.

   When entering full-screen mode, if the window to be used as a
   full-screen window is not visible, this method will make it visible.
   It will remain visible when returning to windowed mode.

   When entering full-screen mode, all the translucency effects are reset for
   the window. Its shape is set to null, the opacity value is set to
   1.0f, and the background color alpha is set to 255 (completely opaque).
   These values are not restored when returning to windowed mode.

   It is unspecified and platform-dependent how decorated windows operate
   in full-screen mode. For this reason, it is recommended to turn off
   the decorations in a Frame or Dialog object by using the
   setUndecorated method.

   When returning to windowed mode from an exclusive full-screen window,
   any display changes made by calling setDisplayMode are
   automatically restored to their original state.
