(defn hash-code
  "Returns a hash code value for the object. This method is
   supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by
   HashMap.

   The general contract of hashCode is:

   Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during
       an execution of a Java application, the hashCode method
       must consistently return the same integer, provided no information
       used in equals comparisons on the object is modified.
       This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an
       application to another execution of the same application.
   If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object)
       method, then calling the hashCode method on each of
       the two objects must produce the same integer result.
   It is not required that if two objects are unequal
       according to the Object.equals(java.lang.Object)
       method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the
       two objects must produce distinct integer results.  However, the
       programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results
       for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.


   As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by
   class Object does return distinct integers for distinct
   objects. (This is typically implemented by converting the internal
   address of the object into an integer, but this implementation
   technique is not required by the
   Javaâ„¢ programming language.)

  returns: a hash code value for this object. - `int`"
  ([this]
    (-> this (.hashCode))))
