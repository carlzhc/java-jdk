(ns jdk.awt.image.ImageFilter
  "This class implements a filter for the set of interface methods that
  are used to deliver data from an ImageProducer to an ImageConsumer.
  It is meant to be used in conjunction with a FilteredImageSource
  object to produce filtered versions of existing images.  It is a
  base class that provides the calls needed to implement a `Null filter`
  which has no effect on the data being passed through.  Filters should
  subclass this class and override the methods which deal with the
  data that needs to be filtered and modify it as necessary."

   An ImageFilter subclass might override this method or not,
   depending on if and how it can send data in TDLR order.
   Three possibilities exist:



   Do not override this method.
   This makes the subclass use the default implementation,
   which is to
   forward the request
   to the indicated ImageProducer
   using this filter as the requesting ImageConsumer.
   This behavior
   is appropriate if the filter can determine
   that it will forward the pixels
   in TDLR order if its upstream producer object
   sends them in TDLR order.


   Override the method to simply send the data.
   This is appropriate if the filter can handle the request itself Â—
   for example,
   if the generated pixels have been saved in some sort of buffer.


   Override the method to do nothing.
   This is appropriate
   if the filter cannot produce filtered data in TDLR order.
