(defn get-available-locales
  "Returns the locales supported by the corresponding input method.
   The locale may describe just the language, or may also include
   country and variant information if needed.
   The information is used to select input methods by locale
   (InputContext.selectInputMethod(Locale)). It may also
   be used to sort input methods by locale in a user-visible
   list of input methods.

   Only the input method's primary locales should be returned.
   For example, if a Japanese input method also has a pass-through
   mode for Roman characters, typically still only Japanese would
   be returned. Thus, the list of locales returned is typically
   a subset of the locales for which the corresponding input method's
   implementation of InputMethod.setLocale(java.util.Locale) returns true.

   If hasDynamicLocaleList() returns true, this method is
   called each time the information is needed. This
   gives input methods that depend on network resources the chance
   to add or remove locales as resources become available or
   unavailable.

  returns: the locales supported by the input method - `java.util.Locale[]`

  throws: java.awt.AWTException - if it can be determined that the input method is inoperable, for example, because of incomplete installation."

   is input.
