(ns jdk.lang.Package
  "Package objects contain version information
  about the implementation and specification of a Java package.
  This versioning information is retrieved and made available
  by the ClassLoader instance that
  loaded the class(es).  Typically, it is stored in the manifest that is
  distributed with the classes.

  The set of classes that make up the package may implement a
  particular specification and if so the specification title, version number,
  and vendor strings identify that specification.
  An application can ask if the package is
  compatible with a particular version, see the isCompatibleWith
  method for details.

  Specification version numbers use a syntax that consists of nonnegative
  decimal integers separated by periods \".\", for example \"2.0\" or
  \"1.2.3.4.5.6.7\".  This allows an extensible number to be used to represent
  major, minor, micro, etc. versions.  The version specification is described
  by the following formal grammar:


  SpecificationVersion:
  Digits RefinedVersionopt

  RefinedVersion:
  . Digits
  . Digits RefinedVersion

  Digits:
  Digit
  Digits

  Digit:
  any character for which Character.isDigit(char) returns true,
  e.g. 0, 1, 2, ...



  The implementation title, version, and vendor strings identify an
  implementation and are made available conveniently to enable accurate
  reporting of the packages involved when a problem occurs. The contents
  all three implementation strings are vendor specific. The
  implementation version strings have no specified syntax and should
  only be compared for equality with desired version identifiers.

  Within each ClassLoader instance all classes from the same
  java package have the same Package object.  The static methods allow a package
  to be found by name or the set of all packages known to the current class
  loader to be found."

(defn *get-package
  "Find a package by name in the callers ClassLoader instance.
   The callers ClassLoader instance is used to find the package
   instance corresponding to the named class. If the callers

   by the system ClassLoader instance is searched to find the
   named package.

   Packages have attributes for versions and specifications only if the class
   loader created the package instance with the appropriate attributes. Typically,
   those attributes are defined in the manifests that accompany the classes.
