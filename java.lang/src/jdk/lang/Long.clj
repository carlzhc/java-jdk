  "The Long class wraps a value of the primitive type long in an object. An object of type Long contains a
  single field whose type is long.

   In addition, this class provides several methods for converting
  a long to a String and a String to a long, as well as other constants and methods useful when dealing
  with a long.

  Implementation note: The implementations of the `bit twiddling`
  methods (such as highestOneBit and
  numberOfTrailingZeros) are
  based on material from Henry S. Warren, Jr.'s Hacker's
