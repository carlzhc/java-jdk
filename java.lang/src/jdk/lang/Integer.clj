  "The Integer class wraps a value of the primitive type
  int in an object. An object of type Integer
  contains a single field whose type is int.

  In addition, this class provides several methods for converting
  an int to a String and a String to an
  int, as well as other constants and methods useful when
  dealing with an int.

  Implementation note: The implementations of the `bit twiddling`
  methods (such as highestOneBit and
  numberOfTrailingZeros) are
  based on material from Henry S. Warren, Jr.'s Hacker's
