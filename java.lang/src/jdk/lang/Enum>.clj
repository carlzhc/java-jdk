  "This is the common base class of all Java language enumeration types.

  More information about enums, including descriptions of the
  implicitly declared methods synthesized by the compiler, can be
  found in section 8.9 of
  The Javaâ„¢ Language Specification.

   Note that when using an enumeration type as the type of a set
  or as the type of the keys in a map, specialized and efficient
  java.util.set and java.util.map implementations are available."

   Note that for a particular enum type T, the
   implicitly declared public static T valueOf(String)
   method on that enum may be used instead of this method to map
   from a name to the corresponding enum constant.  All the
