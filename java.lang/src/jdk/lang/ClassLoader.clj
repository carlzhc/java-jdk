  "A class loader is an object that is responsible for loading classes. The
  class ClassLoader is an abstract class.  Given the binary name of a class, a class loader should attempt to
  locate or generate data that constitutes a definition for the class.  A
  typical strategy is to transform the name into a file name and then read a
  `class file` of that name from a file system.

   Every Class object contains a reference to the ClassLoader that defined
  it.

   Class objects for array classes are not created by class
  loaders, but are created automatically as required by the Java runtime.
  The class loader for an array class, as returned by Class.getClassLoader() is the same as the class loader for its element
  type; if the element type is a primitive type, then the array class has no
  class loader.

   Applications implement subclasses of ClassLoader in order to
  extend the manner in which the Java virtual machine dynamically loads
  classes.

   Class loaders may typically be used by security managers to indicate
  security domains.

   The ClassLoader class uses a delegation model to search for
  classes and resources.  Each instance of ClassLoader has an
  associated parent class loader.  When requested to find a class or
  resource, a ClassLoader instance will delegate the search for the
  class or resource to its parent class loader before attempting to find the
  class or resource itself.  The virtual machine's built-in class loader,
  called the `bootstrap class loader`, does not itself have a parent but may
  serve as the parent of a ClassLoader instance.

   Class loaders that support concurrent loading of classes are known as
  parallel capable class loaders and are required to register
  themselves at their class initialization time by invoking the
  ClassLoader.registerAsParallelCapable
  method. Note that the ClassLoader class is registered as parallel
  capable by default. However, its subclasses still need to register themselves
  if they are parallel capable.
  In environments in which the delegation model is not strictly
  hierarchical, class loaders need to be parallel capable, otherwise class
  loading can lead to deadlocks because the loader lock is held for the
  duration of the class loading process (see loadClass methods).

   Normally, the Java virtual machine loads classes from the local file
  system in a platform-dependent manner.  For example, on UNIX systems, the
  virtual machine loads classes from the directory defined by the
  CLASSPATH environment variable.

   However, some classes may not originate from a file; they may originate
  from other sources, such as the network, or they could be constructed by an
  application.  The method defineClass converts an array of bytes into an instance of class
  Class. Instances of this newly defined class can be created using
  Class.newInstance.

   The methods and constructors of objects created by a class loader may
  reference other classes.  To determine the class(es) referred to, the Java
  virtual machine invokes the loadClass method of
  the class loader that originally created the class.

   For example, an application could create a network class loader to
  download class files from a server.  Sample code might look like:



    ClassLoader loader = new NetworkClassLoader(host, port);
    Object main = loader.loadClass(`Main`, true).newInstance();
         . . .

   The network class loader subclass must define the methods findClass and loadClassData to load a class
  from the network.  Once it has downloaded the bytes that make up the class,
  it should use the method defineClass to
  create a class instance.  A sample implementation is:



      class NetworkClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
          String host;
          int port;

          public Class findClass(String name) {
              byte[] b = loadClassData(name);
              return defineClass(name, b, 0, b.length);
          }

          private byte[] loadClassData(String name) {
              // load the class data from the connection
               . . .
          }
      }

   Binary names

   Any class name provided as a String parameter to methods in
  ClassLoader must be a binary name as defined by
  The Javaâ„¢ Language Specification.

   Examples of valid class names include:


    `java.lang.String`
    `javax.swing.JSpinner$DefaultEditor`
    `java.security.KeyStore$Builder$FileBuilder$1`
    `java.net.URLClassLoader$3$1`"

(defn *get-system-class-loader
  "Returns the system class loader for delegation.  This is the default
   delegation parent for new ClassLoader instances, and is
   typically the class loader used to start the application.

    This method is first invoked early in the runtime's startup
   sequence, at which point it creates the system class loader and sets it
   as the context class loader of the invoking Thread.

    The default system class loader is an implementation-dependent
   instance of this class.

    If the system property `java.system.class.loader` is defined
   when this method is first invoked then the value of that property is
   taken to be the name of a class that will be returned as the system
   class loader.  The class is loaded using the default system class loader
   and must define a public constructor that takes a single parameter of
   type ClassLoader which is used as the delegation parent.  An
   instance is then created using this constructor with the default system
   class loader as the parameter.  The resulting class loader is defined
   to be the system class loader.

    If a security manager is present, and the invoker's class loader is
   not null and the invoker's class loader is not the same as or
   an ancestor of the system class loader, then this method invokes the
   security manager's checkPermission method with a RuntimePermission(`getClassLoader`) permission to verify
   access to the system class loader.  If not, a
   SecurityException will be thrown.
