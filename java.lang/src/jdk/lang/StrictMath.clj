(ns jdk.lang.StrictMath
  "The class StrictMath contains methods for performing basic
  numeric operations such as the elementary exponential, logarithm,
  square root, and trigonometric functions.

  To help ensure portability of Java programs, the definitions of
  some of the numeric functions in this package require that they
  produce the same results as certain published algorithms. These
  algorithms are available from the well-known network library
  netlib as the package `Freely Distributable Math
  Library,` fdlibm. These
  algorithms, which are written in the C programming language, are
  then to be understood as executed with all floating-point
  operations following the rules of Java floating-point arithmetic.

  The Java math library is defined with respect to
  fdlibm version 5.3. Where fdlibm provides
  more than one definition for a function (such as
  acos), use the `IEEE 754 core function` version
  (residing in a file whose name begins with the letter
  e).  The methods which require fdlibm
  semantics are sin, cos, tan,
  asin, acos, atan,
  exp, log, log10,
  cbrt, atan2, pow,
  sinh, cosh, tanh,
  hypot, expm1, and log1p.


  The platform uses signed two's complement integer arithmetic with
  int and long primitive types.  The developer should choose
  the primitive type to ensure that arithmetic operations consistently
  produce correct results, which in some cases means the operations
  will not overflow the range of values of the computation.
  The best practice is to choose the primitive type and algorithm to avoid
  overflow. In cases where the size is int or long and
  overflow errors need to be detected, the methods addExact,
  subtractExact, multiplyExact, and toIntExact
  throw an ArithmeticException when the results overflow.
  For other arithmetic operations such as divide, absolute value,
  increment, decrement, and negation overflow occurs only with
  a specific minimum or maximum value and should be checked against
  the minimum or maximum as appropriate."

   equal).

    If start is
