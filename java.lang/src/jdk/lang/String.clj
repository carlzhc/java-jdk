(ns jdk.lang.String
  "The String class represents character strings. All
  string literals in Java programs, such as `abc`, are
  implemented as instances of this class.

  Strings are constant; their values cannot be changed after they
  are created. String buffers support mutable strings.
  Because String objects are immutable they can be shared. For example:


      String str = `abc`;
  is equivalent to:


      char data[] = {'a', 'b', 'c'};
      String str = new String(data);
  Here are some more examples of how strings can be used:


      System.out.println(`abc`);
      String cde = `cde`;
      System.out.println(`abc`  cde);
      String c = `abc`.substring(2,3);
      String d = cde.substring(1, 2);

  The class String includes methods for examining
  individual characters of the sequence, for comparing strings, for
  searching strings, for extracting substrings, and for creating a
  copy of a string with all characters translated to uppercase or to
  lowercase. Case mapping is based on the Unicode Standard version
  specified by the Character class.

  The Java language provides special support for the string
  concatenation operator (  ), and for conversion of
  other objects to strings. String concatenation is implemented
  through the StringBuilder(or StringBuffer)
  class and its append method.
  String conversions are implemented through the method
  toString, defined by Object and
  inherited by all classes in Java. For additional information on
  string concatenation and conversion, see Gosling, Joy, and Steele,
  The Java Language Specification.

   Unless otherwise noted, passing a null argument to a constructor
  or method in this class will cause a NullPointerException to be
  thrown.

  A String represents a string in the UTF-16 format
  in which supplementary characters are represented by surrogate
  pairs (see the section Unicode
  Character Representations in the Character class for
  more information).
  Index values refer to char code units, so a supplementary
  character uses two positions in a String.
  The String class provides methods for dealing with
  Unicode code points (i.e., characters), in addition to those for
  dealing with Unicode code units (i.e., char values)."
