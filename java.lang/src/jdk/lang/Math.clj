  "The class Math contains methods for performing basic
  numeric operations such as the elementary exponential, logarithm,
  square root, and trigonometric functions.

  Unlike some of the numeric methods of class
  StrictMath, all implementations of the equivalent
  functions of class Math are not defined to return the
  bit-for-bit same results.  This relaxation permits
  better-performing implementations where strict reproducibility is
  not required.

  By default many of the Math methods simply call
  the equivalent method in StrictMath for their
  implementation.  Code generators are encouraged to use
  platform-specific native libraries or microprocessor instructions,
  where available, to provide higher-performance implementations of
  Math methods.  Such higher-performance
  implementations still must conform to the specification for
  Math.

  The quality of implementation specifications concern two
  properties, accuracy of the returned result and monotonicity of the
  method.  Accuracy of the floating-point Math methods is
  measured in terms of ulps, units in the last place.  For a
  given floating-point format, an ulp of a
  specific real number value is the distance between the two
  floating-point values bracketing that numerical value.  When
  discussing the accuracy of a method as a whole rather than at a
  specific argument, the number of ulps cited is for the worst-case
  error at any argument.  If a method always has an error less than
  0.5 ulps, the method always returns the floating-point number
  nearest the exact result; such a method is correctly
  rounded.  A correctly rounded method is generally the best a
  floating-point approximation can be; however, it is impractical for
  many floating-point methods to be correctly rounded.  Instead, for
  the Math class, a larger error bound of 1 or 2 ulps is
  allowed for certain methods.  Informally, with a 1 ulp error bound,
  when the exact result is a representable number, the exact result
  should be returned as the computed result; otherwise, either of the
  two floating-point values which bracket the exact result may be
  returned.  For exact results large in magnitude, one of the
  endpoints of the bracket may be infinite.  Besides accuracy at
  individual arguments, maintaining proper relations between the
  method at different arguments is also important.  Therefore, most
  methods with more than 0.5 ulp errors are required to be
  semi-monotonic: whenever the mathematical function is
  non-decreasing, so is the floating-point approximation, likewise,
  whenever the mathematical function is non-increasing, so is the
  floating-point approximation.  Not all approximations that have 1
  ulp accuracy will automatically meet the monotonicity requirements.


  The platform uses signed two's complement integer arithmetic with
  int and long primitive types.  The developer should choose
  the primitive type to ensure that arithmetic operations consistently
  produce correct results, which in some cases means the operations
  will not overflow the range of values of the computation.
  The best practice is to choose the primitive type and algorithm to avoid
  overflow. In cases where the size is int or long and
  overflow errors need to be detected, the methods addExact,
  subtractExact, multiplyExact, and toIntExact
  throw an ArithmeticException when the results overflow.
  For other arithmetic operations such as divide, absolute value,
  increment, decrement, and negation overflow occurs only with
  a specific minimum or maximum value and should be checked against
  the minimum or maximum as appropriate."

(defn *floor-mod
  "Returns the floor modulus of the int arguments.

   The floor modulus is x - (floorDiv(x, y) * y),
   has the same sign as the divisor y, and
   is in the range of -abs(y) < r < abs(y).


   The relationship between floorDiv and floorMod is such that:

     floorDiv(x, y) * y  floorMod(x, y) == x


   The difference in values between floorMod and
   the % operator is due to the difference between
   floorDiv that returns the integer less than or equal to the quotient
   and the / operator that returns the integer closest to zero.

   Examples:

     If the signs of the arguments are the same, the results
         of floorMod and the % operator are the same.

         floorMod(4, 3) == 1;   and (4 % 3) == 1

     If the signs of the arguments are different, the results differ from the % operator.

        floorMod(+4, -3) == -2;   and (+4 % -3) == 1
        floorMod(-4, 3) == 2;   and (-4 % 3) == -1
        floorMod(-4, -3) == -1;   and (-4 % -3) == -1

   is needed it can be computed as (floorMod(x, y)  abs(y)) % abs(y).
