(ns javax.swing.JLabel
  "A display area for a short text string or an image,
  or both.
  A label does not react to input events.
  As a result, it cannot get the keyboard focus.
  A label can, however, display a keyboard alternative
  as a convenience for a nearby component
  that has a keyboard alternative but can't display it.

  A JLabel object can display
  either text, an image, or both.
  You can specify where in the label's display area
  the label's contents are aligned
  by setting the vertical and horizontal alignment.
  By default, labels are vertically centered
  in their display area.
  Text-only labels are leading edge aligned, by default;
  image-only labels are horizontally centered, by default.

  You can also specify the position of the text
  relative to the image.
  By default, text is on the trailing edge of the image,
  with the text and image vertically aligned.

  A label's leading and trailing edge are determined from the value of its
  ComponentOrientation property.  At present, the default
  ComponentOrientation setting maps the leading edge to left and the trailing
  edge to right.


  Finally, you can use the setIconTextGap method
  to specify how many pixels
  should appear between the text and the image.
  The default is 4 pixels.

  See How to Use Labels
  in The Java Tutorial
  for further documentation.
