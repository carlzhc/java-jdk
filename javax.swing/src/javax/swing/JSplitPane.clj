(ns javax.swing.JSplitPane
  "JSplitPane is used to divide two (and only two)
  Components. The two Components
  are graphically divided based on the look and feel
  implementation, and the two Components can then be
  interactively resized by the user.
  Information on using JSplitPane is in
  How to Use Split Panes in
  The Java Tutorial.

  The two Components in a split pane can be aligned
  left to right using
  JSplitPane.HORIZONTAL_SPLIT, or top to bottom using
  JSplitPane.VERTICAL_SPLIT.
  The preferred way to change the size of the Components
  is to invoke
  setDividerLocation where location is either
  the new x or y position, depending on the orientation of the
  JSplitPane.

  To resize the Components to their preferred sizes invoke
  resetToPreferredSizes.

  When the user is resizing the Components the minimum
  size of the Components is used to determine the
  maximum/minimum position the Components
  can be set to. If the minimum size of the two
  components is greater than the size of the split pane the divider
  will not allow you to resize it. To alter the minimum size of a
  JComponent, see JComponent.setMinimumSize(java.awt.Dimension).

  When the user resizes the split pane the new space is distributed between
  the two components based on the resizeWeight property.
  A value of 0,
  the default, indicates the right/bottom component gets all the space,
  where as a value of 1 indicates the left/top component gets all the space.

  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
  information see Swing's Threading
  Policy.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."
