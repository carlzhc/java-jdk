(ns javax.swing.SizeRequirements
  "For the convenience of layout managers,
  calculates information about the size and position of components.
  All size and position calculation methods are class methods
  that take arrays of SizeRequirements as arguments.
  The SizeRequirements class supports two types of layout:



   tiled
   The components are placed end-to-end,
       starting either at coordinate 0 (the leftmost or topmost position)
       or at the coordinate representing the end of the allocated span
       (the rightmost or bottommost position).

   aligned
   The components are aligned as specified
       by each component's X or Y alignment value.





  Each SizeRequirements object contains information
  about either the width (and X alignment)
  or height (and Y alignment)
  of a single component or a group of components:



   minimum
   The smallest reasonable width/height of the component
       or component group, in pixels.

   preferred
   The natural width/height of the component
       or component group, in pixels.

   maximum
   The largest reasonable width/height of the component
       or component group, in pixels.

   alignment
   The X/Y alignment of the component
       or component group.



  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."
