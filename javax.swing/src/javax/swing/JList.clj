(ns javax.swing.JList
  "A component that displays a list of objects and allows the user to select
  one or more items. A separate model, ListModel, maintains the
  contents of the list.

  It's easy to display an array or Vector of objects, using the JList
  constructor that automatically builds a read-only ListModel instance
  for you:


  // Create a JList that displays strings from an array

  String[] data = {`one`, `two`, `three`, `four`};
  JList<String> myList = new JList<String>(data);

  // Create a JList that displays the superclasses of JList.class, by
  // creating it with a Vector populated with this data

  Vector<Class<?>> superClasses = new Vector<Class<?>>();
  Class<JList> rootClass = javax.swing.JList.class;
  for(Class<?> cls = rootClass; cls != null; cls = cls.getSuperclass()) {
      superClasses.addElement(cls);
  }
  JList<Class<?>> myList = new JList<Class<?>>(superClasses);

  // The automatically created model is stored in JList's `model`
  // property, which you can retrieve

  ListModel<Class<?>> model = myList.getModel();
  for(int i = 0; i < model.getSize(); i++) {
      System.out.println(model.getElementAt(i));
  }

  A ListModel can be supplied directly to a JList by way of a
  constructor or the setModel method. The contents need not be static -
  the number of items, and the values of items can change over time. A correct
  ListModel implementation notifies the set of
  javax.swing.event.ListDataListeners that have been added to it, each
  time a change occurs. These changes are characterized by a
  javax.swing.event.ListDataEvent, which identifies the range of list
  indices that have been modified, added, or removed. JList's
  ListUI is responsible for keeping the visual representation up to
  date with changes, by listening to the model.

  Simple, dynamic-content, JList applications can use the
  DefaultListModel class to maintain list elements. This class
  implements the ListModel interface and also provides a
  java.util.Vector-like API. Applications that need a more
  custom ListModel implementation may instead wish to subclass
  AbstractListModel, which provides basic support for managing and
  notifying listeners. For example, a read-only implementation of
  AbstractListModel:


  // This list model has about 2^16 elements.  Enjoy scrolling.

  ListModel<String> bigData = new AbstractListModel<String>() {
      public int getSize() { return Short.MAX_VALUE; }
      public String getElementAt(int index) { return `Index `  index; }
  };

  The selection state of a JList is managed by another separate
  model, an instance of ListSelectionModel. JList is
  initialized with a selection model on construction, and also contains
  methods to query or set this selection model. Additionally, JList
  provides convenient methods for easily managing the selection. These methods,
  such as setSelectedIndex and getSelectedValue, are cover
  methods that take care of the details of interacting with the selection
  model. By default, JList's selection model is configured to allow any
  combination of items to be selected at a time; selection mode
  MULTIPLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION. The selection mode can be changed
  on the selection model directly, or via JList's cover method.
  Responsibility for updating the selection model in response to user gestures
  lies with the list's ListUI.

  A correct ListSelectionModel implementation notifies the set of
  javax.swing.event.ListSelectionListeners that have been added to it
  each time a change to the selection occurs. These changes are characterized
  by a javax.swing.event.ListSelectionEvent, which identifies the range
  of the selection change.

  The preferred way to listen for changes in list selection is to add
  ListSelectionListeners directly to the JList. JList
  then takes care of listening to the the selection model and notifying your
  listeners of change.

  Responsibility for listening to selection changes in order to keep the list's
  visual representation up to date lies with the list's ListUI.


  Painting of cells in a JList is handled by a delegate called a
  cell renderer, installed on the list as the cellRenderer property.
  The renderer provides a java.awt.Component that is used
  like a `rubber stamp` to paint the cells. Each time a cell needs to be
  painted, the list's ListUI asks the cell renderer for the component,
  moves it into place, and has it paint the contents of the cell by way of its
  paint method. A default cell renderer, which uses a JLabel
  component to render, is installed by the lists's ListUI. You can
  substitute your own renderer using code like this:


   // Display an icon and a string for each object in the list.

  class MyCellRenderer extends JLabel implements ListCellRenderer<Object> {
      final static ImageIcon longIcon = new ImageIcon(`long.gif`);
      final static ImageIcon shortIcon = new ImageIcon(`short.gif`);

      // This is the only method defined by ListCellRenderer.
      // We just reconfigure the JLabel each time we're called.

      public Component getListCellRendererComponent(
        JList<?> list,           // the list
        Object value,            // value to display
        int index,               // cell index
        boolean isSelected,      // is the cell selected
        boolean cellHasFocus)    // does the cell have focus
      {
          String s = value.toString();
          setText(s);
          setIcon((s.length() > 10) ? longIcon : shortIcon);
          if (isSelected) {
              setBackground(list.getSelectionBackground());
              setForeground(list.getSelectionForeground());
          } else {
              setBackground(list.getBackground());
              setForeground(list.getForeground());
          }
          setEnabled(list.isEnabled());
          setFont(list.getFont());
          setOpaque(true);
          return this;
      }
  }

  myList.setCellRenderer(new MyCellRenderer());

  Another job for the cell renderer is in helping to determine sizing
  information for the list. By default, the list's ListUI determines
  the size of cells by asking the cell renderer for its preferred
  size for each list item. This can be expensive for large lists of items.
  To avoid these calculations, you can set a fixedCellWidth and
  fixedCellHeight on the list, or have these values calculated
  automatically based on a single prototype value:



  JList<String> bigDataList = new JList<String>(bigData);

  // We don't want the JList implementation to compute the width
  // or height of all of the list cells, so we give it a string
  // that's as big as we'll need for any cell.  It uses this to
  // compute values for the fixedCellWidth and fixedCellHeight
  // properties.

  bigDataList.setPrototypeCellValue(`Index 1234567890`);

  JList doesn't implement scrolling directly. To create a list that
  scrolls, make it the viewport view of a JScrollPane. For example:


  JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane(myList);

  // Or in two steps:
  JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane();
  scrollPane.getViewport().setView(myList);

  JList doesn't provide any special handling of double or triple
  (or N) mouse clicks, but it's easy to add a MouseListener if you
  wish to take action on these events. Use the locationToIndex
  method to determine what cell was clicked. For example:


  MouseListener mouseListener = new MouseAdapter() {
      public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {
          if (e.getClickCount() == 2) {
              int index = list.locationToIndex(e.getPoint());
              System.out.println(`Double clicked on Item `  index);
           }
      }
  };
  list.addMouseListener(mouseListener);

   the fixedCellWidth, if greater than 0, or a hard-coded

   by visibleRowCount, if fixedCellHeight is greater than
   0, otherwise it is a hard-coded value of 16 multiplied by
