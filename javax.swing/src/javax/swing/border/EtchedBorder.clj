(ns javax.swing.border.EtchedBorder
  "A class which implements a simple etched border which can
  either be etched-in or etched-out.  If no highlight/shadow
  colors are initialized when the border is created, then
  these colors will be dynamically derived from the background
  color of the component argument passed into the paintBorder()
  method.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."
