(ns javax.swing.JLayeredPane
  "JLayeredPane adds depth to a JFC/Swing container,
  allowing components to overlap each other when needed.
  An Integer object specifies each component's depth in the
  container, where higher-numbered components sit \"on top\" of other
  components.
  For task-oriented documentation and examples of using layered panes see
  How to Use a Layered Pane,
  a section in The Java Tutorial.








  For convenience, JLayeredPane divides the depth-range
  into several different layers. Putting a component into one of those
  layers makes it easy to ensure that components overlap properly,
  without having to worry about specifying numbers for specific depths:

     DEFAULT_LAYER
          The standard layer, where most components go. This the bottommost
          layer.
     PALETTE_LAYER
          The palette layer sits over the default layer. Useful for floating
          toolbars and palettes, so they can be positioned above other components.
     MODAL_LAYER
          The layer used for modal dialogs. They will appear on top of any
          toolbars, palettes, or standard components in the container.
     POPUP_LAYER
          The popup layer displays above dialogs. That way, the popup windows
          associated with combo boxes, tooltips, and other help text will appear
          above the component, palette, or dialog that generated them.
     DRAG_LAYER
          When dragging a component, reassigning it to the drag layer ensures
          that it is positioned over every other component in the container. When
          finished dragging, it can be reassigned to its normal layer.

  The JLayeredPane methods moveToFront(Component),
  moveToBack(Component) and setPosition can be used
  to reposition a component within its layer. The setLayer method
  can also be used to change the component's current layer.

  Details
  JLayeredPane manages its list of children like
  Container, but allows for the definition of a several
  layers within itself. Children in the same layer are managed exactly
  like the normal Container object,
  with the added feature that when children components overlap, children
  in higher layers display above the children in lower layers.

  Each layer is a distinct integer number. The layer attribute can be set
  on a Component by passing an Integer
  object during the add call. For example:


      layeredPane.add(child, JLayeredPane.DEFAULT_LAYER);
  or
      layeredPane.add(child, new Integer(10));
  The layer attribute can also be set on a Component by calling

      layeredPaneParent.setLayer(child, 10)
  on the JLayeredPane that is the parent of component. The layer
  should be set before adding the child to the parent.

  Higher number layers display above lower number layers. So, using
  numbers for the layers and letters for individual components, a
  representative list order would look like this:

        5a, 5b, 5c, 2a, 2b, 2c, 1a
  where the leftmost components are closest to the top of the display.

  A component can be moved to the top or bottom position within its
  layer by calling moveToFront or moveToBack.

  The position of a component within a layer can also be specified directly.
  Valid positions range from 0 up to one less than the number of
  components in that layer. A value of -1 indicates the bottommost
  position. A value of 0 indicates the topmost position. Unlike layer
  numbers, higher position values are lower in the display.

  Note: This sequence (defined by java.awt.Container) is the reverse
  of the layer numbering sequence. Usually though, you will use moveToFront,
  moveToBack, and setLayer.

  Here are some examples using the method add(Component, layer, position):
  Calling add(5x, 5, -1) results in:

        5a, 5b, 5c, 5x, 2a, 2b, 2c, 1a

  Calling add(5z, 5, 2) results in:

        5a, 5b, 5z, 5c, 5x, 2a, 2b, 2c, 1a

  Calling add(3a, 3, 7) results in:

        5a, 5b, 5z, 5c, 5x, 3a, 2a, 2b, 2c, 1a

  Using normal paint/event mechanics results in 1a appearing at the bottom
  and 5a being above all other components.

  Note: that these layers are simply a logical construct and LayoutManagers
  will affect all child components of this container without regard for
  layer settings.
