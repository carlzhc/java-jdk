(ns javax.swing.UIManager
  "UIManager manages the current look and feel, the set of
  available look and feels, PropertyChangeListeners that
  are notified when the look and feel changes, look and feel defaults, and
  convenience methods for obtaining various default values.

  Specifying the look and feel

  The look and feel can be specified in two distinct ways: by
  specifying the fully qualified name of the class for the look and
  feel, or by creating an instance of LookAndFeel and passing
  it to setLookAndFeel. The following example illustrates
  setting the look and feel to the system look and feel:


    UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
  The following example illustrates setting the look and feel based on
  class name:


    UIManager.setLookAndFeel(`javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel`);
  Once the look and feel has been changed it is imperative to invoke
  updateUI on all JComponents. The method SwingUtilities.updateComponentTreeUI(java.awt.Component) makes it easy to apply updateUI to a containment hierarchy. Refer to it for
  details. The exact behavior of not invoking updateUI after changing the look and feel is
  unspecified. It is very possible to receive unexpected exceptions,
  painting problems, or worse.

  Default look and feel

  The class used for the default look and feel is chosen in the following
  manner:

    If the system property swing.defaultlaf is
        non-null, use its value as the default look and feel class
        name.
    If the Properties file swing.properties
        exists and contains the key swing.defaultlaf,
        use its value as the default look and feel class name. The location
        that is checked for swing.properties may vary depending
        upon the implementation of the Java platform. Typically the
        swing.properties file is located in the lib
        subdirectory of the Java installation directory.
        Refer to the release notes of the implementation being used for
        further details.
    Otherwise use the cross platform look and feel.


  Defaults

  UIManager manages three sets of UIDefaults. In order, they
  are:

    Developer defaults. With few exceptions Swing does not
        alter the developer defaults; these are intended to be modified
        and used by the developer.
    Look and feel defaults. The look and feel defaults are
        supplied by the look and feel at the time it is installed as the
        current look and feel (setLookAndFeel() is invoked). The
        look and feel defaults can be obtained using the getLookAndFeelDefaults() method.
    System defaults. The system defaults are provided by Swing.

  Invoking any of the various get methods
  results in checking each of the defaults, in order, returning
  the first non-null value. For example, invoking
  UIManager.getString(`Table.foreground`) results in first
  checking developer defaults. If the developer defaults contain
  a value for `Table.foreground` it is returned, otherwise
  the look and feel defaults are checked, followed by the system defaults.

  It's important to note that getDefaults returns a custom
  instance of UIDefaults with this resolution logic built into it.
  For example, UIManager.getDefaults().getString(`Table.foreground`)
  is equivalent to UIManager.getString(`Table.foreground`). Both
  resolve using the algorithm just described. In many places the
  documentation uses the word defaults to refer to the custom instance
  of UIDefaults with the resolution logic as previously described.

  When the look and feel is changed, UIManager alters only the
  look and feel defaults; the developer and system defaults are not
  altered by the UIManager in any way.

  The set of defaults a particular look and feel supports is defined
  and documented by that look and feel. In addition, each look and
  feel, or ComponentUI provided by a look and feel, may
  access the defaults at different times in their life cycle. Some
  look and feels may aggressively look up defaults, so that changing a
  default may not have an effect after installing the look and feel.
  Other look and feels may lazily access defaults so that a change to
  the defaults may effect an existing look and feel. Finally, other look
  and feels might not configure themselves from the defaults table in
  any way. None-the-less it is usually the case that a look and feel
  expects certain defaults, so that in general
  a ComponentUI provided by one look and feel will not
  work with another look and feel.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
