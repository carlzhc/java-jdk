(ns javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalRootPaneUI
  "Provides the metal look and feel implementation of RootPaneUI.

  MetalRootPaneUI provides support for the
  windowDecorationStyle property of JRootPane.
  MetalRootPaneUI does this by way of installing a custom
  LayoutManager, a private Component to render
  the appropriate widgets, and a private Border. The
  LayoutManager is always installed, regardless of the value of
  the windowDecorationStyle property, but the
  Border and Component are only installed/added if
  the windowDecorationStyle is other than
  JRootPane.NONE.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."
