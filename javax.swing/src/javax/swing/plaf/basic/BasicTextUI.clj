(ns javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicTextUI
  " Basis of a text components look-and-feel.  This provides the
  basic editor view and controller services that may be useful
  when creating a look-and-feel for an extension of
  JTextComponent.

  Most state is held in the associated JTextComponent
  as bound properties, and the UI installs default values for the
  various properties.  This default will install something for
  all of the properties.  Typically, a LAF implementation will
  do more however.  At a minimum, a LAF would generally install
  key bindings.

  This class also provides some concurrency support if the
  Document associated with the JTextComponent is a subclass of
  AbstractDocument.  Access to the View (or View hierarchy) is
  serialized between any thread mutating the model and the Swing
  event thread (which is expected to render, do model/view coordinate
  translation, etc).  Any access to the root view should first
  acquire a read-lock on the AbstractDocument and release that lock
  in a finally block.

  An important method to define is the getPropertyPrefix() method
  which is used as the basis of the keys used to fetch defaults
  from the UIManager.  The string should reflect the type of
  TextUI (eg. TextField, TextArea, etc) without the particular
  LAF part of the name (eg Metal, Motif, etc).

  To build a view of the model, one of the following strategies
  can be employed.


  One strategy is to simply redefine the
  ViewFactory interface in the UI.  By default, this UI itself acts
  as the factory for View implementations.  This is useful
  for simple factories.  To do this reimplement the
  create(javax.swing.text.Element) method.

  A common strategy for creating more complex types of documents
  is to have the EditorKit implementation return a factory.  Since
  the EditorKit ties all of the pieces necessary to maintain a type
  of document, the factory is typically an important part of that
  and should be produced by the EditorKit implementation.


  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
