(ns javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicLookAndFeel
  "A base class to use in creating a look and feel for Swing.

  Each of the ComponentUIs provided by BasicLookAndFeel derives its behavior from the defaults
  table. Unless otherwise noted each of the ComponentUI
  implementations in this package document the set of defaults they
  use. Unless otherwise noted the defaults are installed at the time
  installUI is invoked, and follow the recommendations
  outlined in LookAndFeel for installing defaults.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."
