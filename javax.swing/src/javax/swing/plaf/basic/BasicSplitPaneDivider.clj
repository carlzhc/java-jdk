(ns javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicSplitPaneDivider
  "Divider used by BasicSplitPaneUI. Subclassers may wish to override
  paint to do something more interesting.
  The border effect is drawn in BasicSplitPaneUI, so if you don't like
  that border, reset it there.
  To conditionally drag from certain areas subclass mousePressed and
  call super when you wish the dragging to begin.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."
