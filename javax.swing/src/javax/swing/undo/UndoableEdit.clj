(ns javax.swing.undo.UndoableEdit
  "An UndoableEdit represents an edit.  The edit may
  be undone, or if already undone the edit may be redone.

  UndoableEdit is designed to be used with the
  UndoManager.  As UndoableEdits are generated
  by an UndoableEditListener they are typically added to
  the UndoManager.  When an UndoableEdit
  is added to an UndoManager the following occurs (assuming
  end has not been called on the UndoManager):

  If the UndoManager contains edits it will call
      addEdit on the current edit passing in the new edit
      as the argument.  If addEdit returns true the
      new edit is assumed to have been incorporated into the current edit and
      the new edit will not be added to the list of current edits.
      Edits can use addEdit as a way for smaller edits to
      be incorporated into a larger edit and treated as a single edit.
  If addEdit returns false replaceEdit
      is called on the new edit with the current edit passed in as the
      argument. This is the inverse of addEdit Â—
      if the new edit returns true from replaceEdit, the new
      edit replaces the current edit.

  The UndoManager makes use of
  isSignificant to determine how many edits should be
  undone or redone.  The UndoManager will undo or redo
  all insignificant edits (isSignificant returns false)
  between the current edit and the last or
  next significant edit.   addEdit and
  replaceEdit can be used to treat multiple edits as
  a single edit, returning false from isSignificant
  allows for treating can be used to
  have many smaller edits undone or redone at once.  Similar functionality
  can also be done using the addEdit method."

  "Informs the edit that it should no longer be used. Once an
   UndoableEdit has been marked as dead it can no longer
   be undone or redone.

   This is a useful hook for cleaning up state no longer
   needed once undoing or redoing is impossible--for example,
   deleting file resources used by objects that can no longer be
   undeleted. UndoManager calls this before it dequeues edits.

   Note that this is a one-way operation. There is no \"un-die\"
   method."

   edit is typically an edit that should be presented to the user, perhaps

(defn add-edit
  "Adds an UndoableEdit to this UndoableEdit.
   This method can be used to coalesce smaller edits into a larger
   compound edit.  For example, text editors typically allow
   undo operations to apply to words or sentences.  The text
   editor may choose to generate edits on each key event, but allow
   those edits to be coalesced into a more user-friendly unit, such as
   a word. In this case, the UndoableEdit would
   override addEdit to return true when the edits may
   be coalesced.

   A return value of true indicates anEdit was incorporated
   into this edit.  A return value of false indicates anEdit
   may not be incorporated into this edit.
   Typically the receiver is already in the queue of a
   UndoManager (or other UndoableEditListener),
   and is being given a chance to incorporate anEdit
   rather than letting it be added to the queue in turn.

   If true is returned, from now on anEdit must return
   false from canUndo and canRedo,

   redo.
