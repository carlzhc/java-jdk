(ns javax.swing.undo.UndoManager
  "UndoManager manages a list of UndoableEdits,
  providing a way to undo or redo the appropriate edits.  There are
  two ways to add edits to an UndoManager.  Add the edit
  directly using the addEdit method, or add the
  UndoManager to a bean that supports
  UndoableEditListener.  The following examples creates
  an UndoManager and adds it as an
  UndoableEditListener to a JTextField:


    UndoManager undoManager = new UndoManager();
    JTextField tf = ...;
    tf.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(undoManager);

  UndoManager maintains an ordered list of edits and the
  index of the next edit in that list. The index of the next edit is
  either the size of the current list of edits, or if
  undo has been invoked it corresponds to the index
  of the last significant edit that was undone. When
  undo is invoked all edits from the index of the next
  edit to the last significant edit are undone, in reverse order.
  For example, consider an UndoManager consisting of the
  following edits: A b c D.  Edits with a
  upper-case letter in bold are significant, those in lower-case
  and italicized are insignificant.





  Figure 1


  As shown in figure 1, if D was just added, the
  index of the next edit will be 4. Invoking undo
  results in invoking undo on D and setting the
  index of the next edit to 3 (edit c), as shown in the following
  figure.





  Figure 2


  The last significant edit is A, so that invoking
  undo again invokes undo on c,
  b, and A, in that order, setting the index of the
  next edit to 0, as shown in the following figure.





  Figure 3


  Invoking redo results in invoking redo on
  all edits between the index of the next edit and the next
  significant edit (or the end of the list).  Continuing with the previous
  example if redo were invoked, redo would in
  turn be invoked on A, b and c.  In addition
  the index of the next edit is set to 3 (as shown in figure 2).

  Adding an edit to an UndoManager results in
  removing all edits from the index of the next edit to the end of
  the list.  Continuing with the previous example, if a new edit,
  e, is added the edit D is removed from the list
  (after having die invoked on it).  If c is not
  incorporated by the next edit
  (c.addEdit(e) returns true), or replaced
  by it (e.replaceEdit(c) returns true),
  the new edit is added after c, as shown in the following
  figure.

  Once end has been invoked on an UndoManager
  the superclass behavior is used for all UndoableEdit
  methods.  Refer to CompoundEdit for more details on its
  behavior.

  Unlike the rest of Swing, this class is thread safe.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
