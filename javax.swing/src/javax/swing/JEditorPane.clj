(ns javax.swing.JEditorPane
  "A text component to edit various kinds of content.
  You can find how-to information and examples of using editor panes in
  Using Text Components,
  a section in The Java Tutorial.


  This component uses implementations of the
  EditorKit to accomplish its behavior. It effectively
  morphs into the proper kind of text editor for the kind
  of content it is given.  The content type that editor is bound
  to at any given time is determined by the EditorKit currently
  installed.  If the content is set to a new URL, its type is used
  to determine the EditorKit that should be used to
  load the content.

  By default, the following types of content are known:

  text/plain
  Plain text, which is the default the type given isn't
  recognized.  The kit used in this case is an extension of
  DefaultEditorKit that produces a wrapped plain text view.
  text/html
  HTML text.  The kit used in this case is the class
  javax.swing.text.html.HTMLEditorKit
  which provides HTML 3.2 support.
  text/rtf
  RTF text.  The kit used in this case is the class
  javax.swing.text.rtf.RTFEditorKit
  which provides a limited support of the Rich Text Format.


  There are several ways to load content into this component.


  The setText method can be used to initialize
  the component from a string.  In this case the current
  EditorKit will be used, and the content type will be
  expected to be of this type.

  The read method can be used to initialize the
  component from a Reader.  Note that if the content type is HTML,
  relative references (e.g. for things like images) can't be resolved
  unless the <base> tag is used or the Base property
  on HTMLDocument is set.
  In this case the current EditorKit will be used,
  and the content type will be expected to be of this type.

  The setPage method can be used to initialize
  the component from a URL.  In this case, the content type will be
  determined from the URL, and the registered EditorKit
  for that content type will be set.


  Some kinds of content may provide hyperlink support by generating
  hyperlink events.  The HTML EditorKit will generate
  hyperlink events if the JEditorPane is not editable
  (JEditorPane.setEditable(false); has been called).
  If HTML frames are embedded in the document, the typical response would be
  to change a portion of the current document.  The following code
  fragment is a possible hyperlink listener implementation, that treats
  HTML frame events specially, and simply displays any other activated
  hyperlinks.


      class Hyperactive implements HyperlinkListener {

          public void hyperlinkUpdate(HyperlinkEvent e) {
              if (e.getEventType() == HyperlinkEvent.EventType.ACTIVATED) {
                  JEditorPane pane = (JEditorPane) e.getSource();
                  if (e instanceof HTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent) {
                      HTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent  evt = (HTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent)e;
                      HTMLDocument doc = (HTMLDocument)pane.getDocument();
                      doc.processHTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent(evt);
                  } else {
                      try {
                          pane.setPage(e.getURL());
                      } catch (Throwable t) {
                          t.printStackTrace();
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
      }

  Culturally dependent information in some documents is handled through
  a mechanism called character encoding.  Character encoding is an
  unambiguous mapping of the members of a character set (letters, ideographs,
  digits, symbols, or control functions) to specific numeric code values. It
  represents the way the file is stored. Example character encodings are
  ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-5, Shift-jis, Euc-jp, and UTF-8. When the file is
  passed to an user agent (JEditorPane) it is converted to
  the document character set (ISO-10646 aka Unicode).

  There are multiple ways to get a character set mapping to happen
  with JEditorPane.


  One way is to specify the character set as a parameter of the MIME
  type.  This will be established by a call to the
  setContentType method.  If the content
  is loaded by the setPage method the content
  type will have been set according to the specification of the URL.
  It the file is loaded directly, the content type would be expected to
  have been set prior to loading.

  Another way the character set can be specified is in the document itself.
  This requires reading the document prior to determining the character set
  that is desired.  To handle this, it is expected that the
  EditorKit.read operation throw a
  ChangedCharSetException which will
  be caught.  The read is then restarted with a new Reader that uses
  the character set specified in the ChangedCharSetException
  (which is an IOException).

  DefaultEditorKit.

   This is implemented to remove the contents of the current document,
   and replace them by parsing the given string using the current
   EditorKit.  This gives the semantics of the
   superclass by not changing
   out the model, while supporting the content type currently set on
   this component.  The assumption is that the previous content is
   relatively
   small, and that the previous content doesn't have side effects.
   Both of those assumptions can be violated and cause undesirable results.
   To avoid this, create a new document,
   getEditorKit().createDefaultDocument(), and replace the
   existing Document with the new one. You are then assured the
   previous Document won't have any lingering state.


   Leaving the existing model in place means that the old view will be
   torn down, and a new view created, where replacing the document would
   avoid the tear down of the old view.

   Some formats (such as HTML) can install things into the document that
   can influence future contents.  HTML can have style information embedded
   that would influence the next content installed unexpectedly.


   An alternative way to load this component with a string would be to
   create a StringReader and call the read method.  In this case the model
   would be replaced after it was initialized with the contents of the

   If the URL contains and reference location, the location will
   be scrolled to by calling the scrollToReference
   method. If the desired URL is the one currently being displayed,
   the document will not be reloaded. To force a document
   reload it is necessary to clear the stream description property
   of the document. The following code shows how this can be done:



     Document doc = jEditorPane.getDocument();
     doc.putProperty(Document.StreamDescriptionProperty, null);

   If the desired URL is not the one currently being
   displayed, the getStream method is called to
   give subclasses control over the stream provided.

   This may load either synchronously or asynchronously
   depending upon the document returned by the EditorKit.
   If the Document is of type
   AbstractDocument and has a value returned by
   AbstractDocument.getAsynchronousLoadPriority
   that is greater than or equal to zero, the page will be
   loaded on a separate thread using that priority.

   If the document is loaded synchronously, it will be
   filled in with the stream prior to being installed into
   the editor with a call to setDocument, which
   is bound and will fire a property change event.  If an
   IOException is thrown the partially loaded
   document will
   be discarded and neither the document or page property
   change events will be fired.  If the document is
   successfully loaded and installed, a view will be
   built for it by the UI which will then be scrolled if
   necessary, and then the page property change event
   will be fired.

   If the document is loaded asynchronously, the document
   will be installed into the editor immediately using a
   call to setDocument which will fire a
   document property change event, then a thread will be
   created which will begin doing the actual loading.
   In this case, the page property change event will not be
   fired by the call to this method directly, but rather will be
   fired when the thread doing the loading has finished.
   It will also be fired on the event-dispatch thread.
   Since the calling thread can not throw an IOException
   in the event of failure on the other thread, the page
   property change event will be fired when the other
   thread is done whether the load was successful or not.
