  "An event reported to a child component that originated from an
  ancestor in the component hierarchy.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage

  has been added to the java.beans package.

  Constructs an AncestorEvent object to identify a change

  id - an int specifying ANCESTOR_ADDED, ANCESTOR_REMOVED or ANCESTOR_MOVED - `int`
  ancestor - a Container object specifying the ancestor-component whose display-status changed - `java.awt.Container`
  ancestor-parent - a Container object specifying the ancestor's parent - `java.awt.Container`"
