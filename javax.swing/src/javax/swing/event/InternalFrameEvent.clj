(ns javax.swing.event.InternalFrameEvent
  "An AWTEvent that adds support for
  JInternalFrame objects as the event source.  This class has the
  same event types as WindowEvent,
  although different IDs are used.
  Help on handling internal frame events
  is in
  How to Write an Internal Frame Listener,
  a section in The Java Tutorial.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."
