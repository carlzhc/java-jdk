(ns javax.swing.event.TreeSelectionEvent
  "An event that characterizes a change in the current
  selection.  The change is based on any number of paths.
  TreeSelectionListeners will generally query the source of
  the event for the new selected status of each potentially
  changed row.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."
