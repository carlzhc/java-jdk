(defn ->hyperlink-event
  "Constructor.

  Creates a new object representing a hypertext link event.

  source - the object responsible for the event - `java.lang.Object`
  type - the event type - `javax.swing.event.HyperlinkEvent.EventType`
  u - the affected URL. This may be null if a valid URL could not be created. - `java.net.URL`
  desc - the description of the link. This may be useful when attempting to form a URL resulted in a MalformedURLException. The description provides the text used when attempting to form the URL. - `java.lang.String`
  source-element - Element in the Document representing the anchor - `javax.swing.text.Element`
  input-event - InputEvent that triggered the hyperlink event - `java.awt.event.InputEvent`"
