(defn ->tree-model-event
  "Constructor.

  Used to create an event when nodes have been changed, inserted, or
   removed, identifying the path to the parent of the modified items as
   an array of Objects. All of the modified objects are siblings which are
   direct descendents (not grandchildren) of the specified parent.
   The positions at which the inserts, deletes, or changes occurred are
   specified by an array of int. The indexes in that array
   must be in order, from lowest to highest.

   For changes, the indexes in the model correspond exactly to the indexes
   of items currently displayed in the UI. As a result, it is not really
   critical if the indexes are not in their exact order. But after multiple
   inserts or deletes, the items currently in the UI no longer correspond
   to the items in the model. It is therefore critical to specify the
   indexes properly for inserts and deletes.

   For inserts, the indexes represent the final state of the tree,
   after the inserts have occurred. Since the indexes must be specified in
   order, the most natural processing methodology is to do the inserts
   starting at the lowest index and working towards the highest. Accumulate
   a Vector of Integer objects that specify the
   insert-locations as you go, then convert the Vector to an
   array of int to create the event. When the postition-index
   equals zero, the node is inserted at the beginning of the list. When the
   position index equals the size of the list, the node is `inserted` at
   (appended to) the end of the list.

   For deletes, the indexes represent the initial state of the tree,
   before the deletes have occurred. Since the indexes must be specified in
   order, the most natural processing methodology is to use a delete-counter.
   Start by initializing the counter to zero and start work through the
   list from lowest to highest. Every time you do a delete, add the current
   value of the delete-counter to the index-position where the delete occurred,
   and append the result to a Vector of delete-locations, using
   addElement(). Then increment the delete-counter. The index
   positions stored in the Vector therefore reflect the effects of all previous
   deletes, so they represent each object's position in the initial tree.
   (You could also start at the highest index and working back towards the
   lowest, accumulating a Vector of delete-locations as you go using the
   insertElementAt(Integer, 0).) However you produce the Vector
   of initial-positions, you then need to convert the Vector of Integer
   objects to an array of int to create the event.

   Notes:
   Like the insertNodeInto method in the
      DefaultTreeModel class, insertElementAt
      appends to the Vector when the index matches the size
      of the vector. So you can use insertElementAt(Integer, 0)
      even when the vector is empty.
   To create a node changed event for the root node, specify the parent
       and the child indices as null.

  source - the Object responsible for generating the event (typically the creator of the event object passes this for its value) - `java.lang.Object`
  path - an array of Object identifying the path to the parent of the modified item(s), where the first element of the array is the Object stored at the root node and the last element is the Object stored at the parent node - `java.lang.Object[]`
  child-indices - an array of int that specifies the index values of the removed items. The indices must be in sorted order, from lowest to highest - `int[]`
  children - an array of Object containing the inserted, removed, or changed objects - `java.lang.Object[]`"
