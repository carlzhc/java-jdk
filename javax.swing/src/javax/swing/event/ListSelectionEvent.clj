(ns javax.swing.event.ListSelectionEvent
  "An event that characterizes a change in selection. The change is limited to a
  a single inclusive interval. The selection of at least one index within the
  range will have changed. A decent ListSelectionModel implementation
  will keep the range as small as possible. ListSelectionListeners will
  generally query the source of the event for the new selected status of each
  potentially changed row.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."
