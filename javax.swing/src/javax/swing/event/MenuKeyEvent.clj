  "MenuKeyEvent is used to notify interested parties that
  the menu element has received a KeyEvent forwarded to it
  in a menu tree.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
