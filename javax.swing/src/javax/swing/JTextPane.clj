(ns javax.swing.JTextPane
  "A text component that can be marked up with attributes that are
  represented graphically.
  You can find how-to information and examples of using text panes in
  Using Text Components,
  a section in The Java Tutorial.


  This component models paragraphs
  that are composed of runs of character level attributes.  Each
  paragraph may have a logical style attached to it which contains
  the default attributes to use if not overridden by attributes set
  on the paragraph or character run.  Components and images may
  be embedded in the flow of text.


  Newlines

  For a discussion on how newlines are handled, see
  DefaultEditorKit.

  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is

   The component given is the actual component used by the
   JTextPane.  Since components cannot be a child of more than
   one container, this method should not be used in situations
   where the model is shared by text components.

   The component is placed relative to the text baseline
   according to the value returned by
   Component.getAlignmentY.  For Swing components
   this value can be conveniently set using the method
   JComponent.setAlignmentY.  For example, setting
   a value of 0.75 will cause 75 percent of the
   component to be above the baseline, and 25 percent of the
   component to be below the baseline.
