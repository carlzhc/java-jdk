(ns javax.swing.tree.DefaultMutableTreeNode
  "A DefaultMutableTreeNode is a general-purpose node in a tree data
  structure.
  For examples of using default mutable tree nodes, see
  How to Use Trees
  in The Java Tutorial.



  A tree node may have at most one parent and 0 or more children.
  DefaultMutableTreeNode provides operations for examining and modifying a
  node's parent and children and also operations for examining the tree that
  the node is a part of.  A node's tree is the set of all nodes that can be
  reached by starting at the node and following all the possible links to
  parents and children.  A node with no parent is the root of its tree; a
  node with no children is a leaf.  A tree may consist of many subtrees,
  each node acting as the root for its own subtree.

  This class provides enumerations for efficiently traversing a tree or
  subtree in various orders or for following the path between two nodes.
  A DefaultMutableTreeNode may also hold a reference to a user object, the
  use of which is left to the user.  Asking a DefaultMutableTreeNode for its
  string representation with toString() returns the string
  representation of its user object.

  This is not a thread safe class.If you intend to use
  a DefaultMutableTreeNode (or a tree of TreeNodes) in more than one thread, you
  need to do your own synchronizing. A good convention to adopt is
  synchronizing on the root node of a tree.

  While DefaultMutableTreeNode implements the MutableTreeNode interface and
  will allow you to add in any implementation of MutableTreeNode not all
  of the methods in DefaultMutableTreeNode will be applicable to all
  MutableTreeNodes implementations. Especially with some of the enumerations
  that are provided, using some of these methods assumes the
  DefaultMutableTreeNode contains only DefaultMutableNode instances. All
  of the TreeNode/MutableTreeNode methods will behave as defined no
  matter what implementations are added.


  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."
