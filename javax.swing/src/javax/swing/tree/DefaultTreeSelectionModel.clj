(ns javax.swing.tree.DefaultTreeSelectionModel
  "Default implementation of TreeSelectionModel.  Listeners are notified
  whenever
  the paths in the selection change, not the rows. In order
  to be able to track row changes you may wish to become a listener
  for expansion events on the tree and test for changes from there.
  resetRowSelection is called from any of the methods that update
  the selected paths. If you subclass any of these methods to
  filter what is allowed to be selected, be sure and message
  resetRowSelection if you do not message super.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
