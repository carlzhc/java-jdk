(ns javax.swing.tree.TreePath
  "TreePath represents an array of objects that uniquely
  identify the path to a node in a tree. The elements of the array
  are ordered with the root as the first element of the array. For
  example, a file on the file system is uniquely identified based on
  the array of parent directories and the name of the file. The path
  /tmp/foo/bar could be represented by a TreePath as
  new TreePath(new Object[] {`tmp`, `foo`, `bar`}).

  TreePath is used extensively by JTree and related classes.
  For example, JTree represents the selection as an array of
  TreePaths. When used with JTree, the elements of the
  path are the objects returned from the TreeModel. When JTree
  is paired with DefaultTreeModel, the elements of the
  path are TreeNodes. The following example illustrates extracting
  the user object from the selection of a JTree:


    DefaultMutableTreeNode root = ...;
    DefaultTreeModel model = new DefaultTreeModel(root);
    JTree tree = new JTree(model);
    ...
    TreePath selectedPath = tree.getSelectionPath();
    DefaultMutableTreeNode selectedNode =
        ((DefaultMutableTreeNode)selectedPath.getLastPathComponent()).
        getUserObject();
  Subclasses typically need override only getLastPathComponent, and getParentPath. As JTree
  internally creates TreePaths at various points, it's
  generally not useful to subclass TreePath and use with
  JTree.

  While TreePath is serializable, a NotSerializableException is thrown if any elements of the path are
  not serializable.

  For further information and examples of using tree paths,
  see How to Use Trees
  in The Java Tutorial.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."
