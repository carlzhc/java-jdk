(ns javax.swing.JTextField
  "JTextField is a lightweight component that allows the editing
  of a single line of text.
  For information on and examples of using text fields,
  see
  How to Use Text Fields
  in The Java Tutorial.


  JTextField is intended to be source-compatible
  with java.awt.TextField where it is reasonable to do so.  This
  component has capabilities not found in the java.awt.TextField
  class.  The superclass should be consulted for additional capabilities.

  JTextField has a method to establish the string used as the
  command string for the action event that gets fired.  The
  java.awt.TextField used the text of the field as the command
  string for the ActionEvent.
  JTextField will use the command
  string set with the setActionCommand method if not null,
  otherwise it will use the text of the field as a compatibility with
  java.awt.TextField.

  The method setEchoChar and getEchoChar
  are not provided directly to avoid a new implementation of a
  pluggable look-and-feel inadvertently exposing password characters.
  To provide password-like services a separate class JPasswordField
  extends JTextField to provide this service with an independently
  pluggable look-and-feel.

  The java.awt.TextField could be monitored for changes by adding
  a TextListener for TextEvent's.
  In the JTextComponent based
  components, changes are broadcasted from the model via a
  DocumentEvent to DocumentListeners.
  The DocumentEvent gives
  the location of the change and the kind of change if desired.
  The code fragment might look something like:


      DocumentListener myListener = ??;
      JTextField myArea = ??;
      myArea.getDocument().addDocumentListener(myListener);

  The horizontal alignment of JTextField can be set to be left
  justified, leading justified, centered, right justified or trailing justified.
  Right/trailing justification is useful if the required size
  of the field text is smaller than the size allocated to it.
  This is determined by the setHorizontalAlignment
  and getHorizontalAlignment methods.  The default
  is to be leading justified.

  How the text field consumes VK_ENTER events depends
  on whether the text field has any action listeners.
  If so, then VK_ENTER results in the listeners
  getting an ActionEvent,
  and the VK_ENTER event is consumed.
  This is compatible with how AWT text fields handle VK_ENTER events.
  If the text field has no action listeners, then as of v 1.3 the VK_ENTER
  event is not consumed.  Instead, the bindings of ancestor components
  are processed, which enables the default button feature of
  JFC/Swing to work.

  Customized fields can easily be created by extending the model and
  changing the default model provided.  For example, the following piece
  of code will create a field that holds only upper case characters.  It
  will work even if text is pasted into from the clipboard or it is altered via
  programmatic changes.


  public class UpperCaseField extends JTextField {

      public UpperCaseField(int cols) {
          super(cols);
      }

      protected Document createDefaultModel() {
          return new UpperCaseDocument();
      }

      static class UpperCaseDocument extends PlainDocument {

          public void insertString(int offs, String str, AttributeSet a)
              throws BadLocationException {

              if (str == null) {
                  return;
              }
              char[] upper = str.toCharArray();
              for (int i = 0; i < upper.length; i++) {
                  upper[i] = Character.toUpperCase(upper[i]);
              }
              super.insertString(offs, new String(upper), a);
          }
      }
  }

  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
  information see Swing's Threading
  Policy.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
