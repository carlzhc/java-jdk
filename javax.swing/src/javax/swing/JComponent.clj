(ns javax.swing.JComponent
  "The base class for all Swing components except top-level containers.
  To use a component that inherits from JComponent,
  you must place the component in a containment hierarchy
  whose root is a top-level Swing container.
  Top-level Swing containers --
  such as JFrame, JDialog,
  and JApplet --
  are specialized components
  that provide a place for other Swing components to paint themselves.
  For an explanation of containment hierarchies, see
  Swing Components and the Containment Hierarchy,
  a section in The Java Tutorial.


  The JComponent class provides:

  The base class for both standard and custom components
      that use the Swing architecture.
  A `pluggable look and feel` (L&F) that can be specified by the
      programmer or (optionally) selected by the user at runtime.
      The look and feel for each component is provided by a
      UI delegate -- an object that descends from
      ComponentUI.
      See How
      to Set the Look and Feel
      in The Java Tutorial
      for more information.
  Comprehensive keystroke handling.
      See the document How to Use Key Bindings,
      an article in The Java Tutorial,
      for more information.
  Support for tool tips --
      short descriptions that pop up when the cursor lingers
      over a component.
      See How
      to Use Tool Tips
      in The Java Tutorial
      for more information.
  Support for accessibility.
      JComponent contains all of the methods in the
      Accessible interface,
      but it doesn't actually implement the interface.  That is the
      responsibility of the individual classes
      that extend JComponent.
  Support for component-specific properties.
      With the putClientProperty(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)
      and getClientProperty(java.lang.Object) methods,
      you can associate name-object pairs
      with any object that descends from JComponent.
  An infrastructure for painting
      that includes double buffering and support for borders.
      For more information see Painting and
  How
      to Use Borders,
      both of which are sections in The Java Tutorial.

  For more information on these subjects, see the
  Swing package description
  and The Java Tutorial section
  The JComponent Class.

  JComponent and its subclasses document default values
  for certain properties.  For example, JTable documents the
  default row height as 16.  Each JComponent subclass
  that has a ComponentUI will create the
  ComponentUI as part of its constructor.  In order
  to provide a particular look and feel each
  ComponentUI may set properties back on the
  JComponent that created it.  For example, a custom
  look and feel may require JTables to have a row
  height of 24. The documented defaults are the value of a property
  BEFORE the ComponentUI has been installed.  If you
  need a specific value for a particular property you should
  explicitly set it.

  In release 1.4, the focus subsystem was rearchitected.
  For more information, see

  How to Use the Focus Subsystem,
  a section in The Java Tutorial.

  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
  information see Swing's Threading
  Policy.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.

  "This method is now obsolete, please use a combination of

   aKeyStroke to the Action anAction
   now use:


     component.getInputMap().put(aKeyStroke, aCommand);
     component.getActionMap().put(aCommmand, anAction);
   The above assumes you want the binding to be applicable for
   WHEN_FOCUSED. To register bindings for other focus
   states use the getInputMap method that takes an integer.

   Register a new keyboard action.
   anAction will be invoked if a key event matching
   aKeyStroke occurs and aCondition is verified.
   The KeyStroke object defines a
   particular combination of a keyboard key and one or more modifiers
   (alt, shift, ctrl, meta).

   The aCommand will be set in the delivered event if
   specified.

   The aCondition can be one of:


   WHEN_FOCUSED
   The action will be invoked only when the keystroke occurs
       while the component has the focus.
   WHEN_IN_FOCUSED_WINDOW
   The action will be invoked when the keystroke occurs while
       the component has the focus or if the component is in the
       window that has the focus. Note that the component need not
       be an immediate descendent of the window -- it can be
       anywhere in the window's containment hierarchy. In other
       words, whenever any component in the window has the focus,
       the action registered with this component is invoked.
   WHEN_ANCESTOR_OF_FOCUSED_COMPONENT
   The action will be invoked when the keystroke occurs while the
       component has the focus or if the component is an ancestor of
       the component that has the focus.



   The combination of keystrokes and conditions lets you define high
   level (semantic) action events for a specified keystroke+modifier
   combination (using the KeyStroke class) and direct to a parent or
   child of a component that has the focus, or to the component itself.
   In other words, in any hierarchical structure of components, an
   arbitrary key-combination can be immediately directed to the
   appropriate component in the hierarchy, and cause a specific method
   to be invoked (usually by way of adapter objects).
