(ns javax.swing.OverlayLayout
  "A layout manager to arrange components over the top
  of each other.  The requested size of the container
  will be the largest requested size of the children,
  taking alignment needs into consideration.

  The alignment is based upon what is needed to properly
  fit the children in the allocation area.  The children
  will be placed such that their alignment points are all
  on top of each other.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."
