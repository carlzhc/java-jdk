(ns javax.swing.JDesktopPane
  "A container used to create a multiple-document interface or a virtual desktop.
  You create JInternalFrame objects and add them to the
  JDesktopPane. JDesktopPane extends
  JLayeredPane to manage the potentially overlapping internal
  frames. It also maintains a reference to an instance of
  DesktopManager that is set by the UI
  class for the current look and feel (L&F).  Note that JDesktopPane
  does not support borders.

  This class is normally used as the parent of JInternalFrames
  to provide a pluggable DesktopManager object to the
  JInternalFrames. The installUI of the
  L&F specific implementation is responsible for setting the
  desktopManager variable appropriately.
  When the parent of a JInternalFrame is a JDesktopPane,
  it should delegate most of its behavior to the desktopManager
  (closing, resizing, etc).

  For further documentation and examples see
  How to Use Internal Frames,
  a section in The Java Tutorial.

  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
  information see Swing's Threading
  Policy.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."

(defn set-component-z-order
  "Moves the specified component to the specified z-order index in
   the container. The z-order determines the order that components
   are painted; the component with the highest z-order paints first
   and the component with the lowest z-order paints last.
   Where components overlap, the component with the lower
   z-order paints over the component with the higher z-order.

   If the component is a child of some other container, it is
   removed from that container before being added to this container.
   The important difference between this method and
   java.awt.Container.add(Component, int) is that this method
   doesn't call removeNotify on the component while
   removing it from its previous container unless necessary and when
   allowed by the underlying native windowing system. This way, if the
   component has the keyboard focus, it maintains the focus when
   moved to the new position.

   This property is guaranteed to apply only to lightweight
   non-Container components.

   This method changes layout-related information, and therefore,
   invalidates the component hierarchy.

   Note: Not all platforms support changing the z-order of
   heavyweight components from one container into another without
   the call to removeNotify. There is no way to detect
   whether a platform supports this, so developers shouldn't make
   any assumptions.
