(ns javax.swing.JWindow
  "A JWindow is a container that can be displayed anywhere on the
  user's desktop. It does not have the title bar, window-management buttons,
  or other trimmings associated with a JFrame, but it is still a
  `first-class citizen` of the user's desktop, and can exist anywhere
  on it.

  The JWindow component contains a JRootPane
  as its only child.  The contentPane should be the parent
  of any children of the JWindow.
  As a convenience, the add, remove, and setLayout
  methods of this class are overridden, so that they delegate calls
  to the corresponding methods of the ContentPane.
  For example, you can add a child component to a window as follows:


        window.add(child);
  And the child will be added to the contentPane.
  The contentPane will always be non-null.
  Attempting to set it to null will cause the JWindow
  to throw an exception. The default contentPane will have a
  BorderLayout manager set on it.
  Refer to RootPaneContainer
  for details on adding, removing and setting the LayoutManager
  of a JWindow.

  Please see the JRootPane documentation for a complete description of
  the contentPane, glassPane, and
  layeredPane components.

  In a multi-screen environment, you can create a JWindow
  on a different screen device.  See Window for more
  information.

  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
  information see Swing's Threading
  Policy.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."
