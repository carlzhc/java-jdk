(ns javax.swing.JFrame
  "An extended version of java.awt.Frame that adds support for
  the JFC/Swing component architecture.
  You can find task-oriented documentation about using JFrame
  in The Java Tutorial, in the section
  How to Make Frames.


  The JFrame class is slightly incompatible with Frame.
  Like all other JFC/Swing top-level containers,
  a JFrame contains a JRootPane as its only child.
  The content pane provided by the root pane should,
  as a rule, contain
  all the non-menu components displayed by the JFrame.
  This is different from the AWT Frame case.
  As a convenience, the add, remove, and setLayout
  methods of this class are overridden, so that they delegate calls
  to the corresponding methods of the ContentPane.
  For example, you can add a child component to a frame as follows:


        frame.add(child);
  And the child will be added to the contentPane.
  The content pane will
  always be non-null. Attempting to set it to null will cause the JFrame
  to throw an exception. The default content pane will have a BorderLayout
  manager set on it.
  Refer to RootPaneContainer
  for details on adding, removing and setting the LayoutManager
  of a JFrame.

  Unlike a Frame, a JFrame has some notion of how to
  respond when the user attempts to close the window. The default behavior
  is to simply hide the JFrame when the user closes the window. To change the
  default behavior, you invoke the method
  setDefaultCloseOperation(int).
  To make the JFrame behave the same as a Frame
  instance, use
  setDefaultCloseOperation(WindowConstants.DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE).

  For more information on content panes
  and other features that root panes provide,
  see Using Top-Level Containers in The Java Tutorial.

  In a multi-screen environment, you can create a JFrame
  on a different screen device.  See Frame for more
  information.

  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
  information see Swing's Threading
  Policy.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
