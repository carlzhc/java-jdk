(ns javax.swing.table.DefaultTableCellRenderer
  "The standard class for rendering (displaying) individual cells
  in a JTable.


  Implementation Note:
  This class inherits from JLabel, a standard component class.
  However JTable employs a unique mechanism for rendering
  its cells and therefore requires some slightly modified behavior
  from its cell renderer.
  The table class defines a single cell renderer and uses it as a
  as a rubber-stamp for rendering all cells in the table;
  it renders the first cell,
  changes the contents of that cell renderer,
  shifts the origin to the new location, re-draws it, and so on.
  The standard JLabel component was not
  designed to be used this way and we want to avoid
  triggering a revalidate each time the
  cell is drawn. This would greatly decrease performance because the
  revalidate message would be
  passed up the hierarchy of the container to determine whether any other
  components would be affected.
  As the renderer is only parented for the lifetime of a painting operation
  we similarly want to avoid the overhead associated with walking the
  hierarchy for painting operations.
  So this class
  overrides the validate, invalidate,
  revalidate, repaint, and
  firePropertyChange methods to be
  no-ops and override the isOpaque method solely to improve
  performance.  If you write your own renderer,
  please keep this performance consideration in mind.


  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."
