(ns javax.swing.table.DefaultTableModel
  "This is an implementation of TableModel that
  uses a Vector of Vectors to store the
  cell value objects.

  Warning: DefaultTableModel returns a
  column class of Object.  When
  DefaultTableModel is used with a
  TableRowSorter this will result in extensive use of
  toString, which for non-String data types
  is expensive.  If you use DefaultTableModel with a
  TableRowSorter you are strongly encouraged to override
  getColumnClass to return the appropriate type.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."
