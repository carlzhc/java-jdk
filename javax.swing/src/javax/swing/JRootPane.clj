(ns javax.swing.JRootPane
  "A lightweight container used behind the scenes by
  JFrame, JDialog, JWindow,
  JApplet, and JInternalFrame.
  For task-oriented information on functionality provided by root panes
  see How to Use Root Panes,
  a section in The Java Tutorial.


  The following image shows the relationships between
  the classes that use root panes.

  The `heavyweight` components (those that delegate to a peer, or native
  component on the host system) are shown with a darker, heavier box. The four
  heavyweight JFC/Swing containers (JFrame, JDialog,
  JWindow, and JApplet) are
  shown in relation to the AWT classes they extend.
  These four components are the
  only heavyweight containers in the Swing library. The lightweight container
  JInternalFrame is also shown.
  All five of these JFC/Swing containers implement the
  RootPaneContainer interface,
  and they all delegate their operations to a
  JRootPane (shown with a little `handle` on top).

  Note: The JComponent method getRootPane
  can be used to obtain the JRootPane that contains
  a given component.








  The diagram at right shows the structure of a JRootPane.
  A JRootpane is made up of a glassPane,
  an optional menuBar, and a contentPane.
  (The JLayeredPane manages the menuBar
  and the contentPane.)
  The glassPane sits over the top of everything,
  where it is in a position to intercept mouse movements.
  Since the glassPane (like the contentPane)
  can be an arbitrary component, it is also possible to set up the
  glassPane for drawing. Lines and images on the
  glassPane can then range
  over the frames underneath without being limited by their boundaries.

  Although the menuBar component is optional,
  the layeredPane, contentPane,
  and glassPane always exist.
  Attempting to set them to null generates an exception.

  To add components to the JRootPane (other than the
  optional menu bar), you add the object to the contentPane
  of the JRootPane, like this:


        rootPane.getContentPane().add(child);
  The same principle holds true for setting layout managers, removing
  components, listing children, etc. All these methods are invoked on
  the contentPane instead of on the JRootPane.

  Note: The default layout manager for the contentPane is
   a BorderLayout manager. However, the JRootPane
   uses a custom LayoutManager.
   So, when you want to change the layout manager for the components you added
   to a JRootPane, be sure to use code like this:


     rootPane.getContentPane().setLayout(new BoxLayout());
  If a JMenuBar component is set on the JRootPane,
  it is positioned along the upper edge of the frame.
  The contentPane is adjusted in location and size to
  fill the remaining area.
  (The JMenuBar and the contentPane are added to the
  layeredPane component at the
  JLayeredPane.FRAME_CONTENT_LAYER layer.)

  The layeredPane is the parent of all children in the
  JRootPane -- both as the direct parent of the menu and
  the grandparent of all components added to the contentPane.
  It is an instance of JLayeredPane,
  which provides the ability to add components at several layers.
  This capability is very useful when working with menu popups,
  dialog boxes, and dragging -- situations in which you need to place
  a component on top of all other components in the pane.

  The glassPane sits on top of all other components in the
  JRootPane.
  That provides a convenient place to draw above all other components,
  and makes it possible to intercept mouse events,
  which is useful both for dragging and for drawing.
  Developers can use setVisible on the glassPane
  to control when the glassPane displays over the other children.
  By default the glassPane is not visible.

  The custom LayoutManager used by JRootPane
  ensures that:

  The glassPane fills the entire viewable
      area of the JRootPane (bounds - insets).
  The layeredPane fills the entire viewable area of the
      JRootPane. (bounds - insets)
  The menuBar is positioned at the upper edge of the
      layeredPane.
  The contentPane fills the entire viewable area,
      minus the menuBar, if present.

  Any other views in the JRootPane view hierarchy are ignored.

  If you replace the LayoutManager of the JRootPane,
  you are responsible for managing all of these views.
  So ordinarily you will want to be sure that you
  change the layout manager for the contentPane rather than
  for the JRootPane itself!

  The painting architecture of Swing requires an opaque
  JComponent
  to exist in the containment hierarchy above all other components. This is
  typically provided by way of the content pane. If you replace the content
  pane, it is recommended that you make the content pane opaque
  by way of setOpaque(true). Additionally, if the content pane
  overrides paintComponent, it
  will need to completely fill in the background in an opaque color in
  paintComponent.
