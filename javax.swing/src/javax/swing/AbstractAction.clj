(ns javax.swing.AbstractAction
  "This class provides default implementations for the JFC Action
  interface. Standard behaviors like the get and set methods for
  Action object properties (icon, text, and enabled) are defined
  here. The developer need only subclass this abstract class and
  define the actionPerformed method.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."
