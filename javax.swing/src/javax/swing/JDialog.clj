(ns javax.swing.JDialog
  "The main class for creating a dialog window. You can use this class
  to create a custom dialog, or invoke the many class methods
  in JOptionPane to create a variety of standard dialogs.
  For information about creating dialogs, see
  The Java Tutorial section
  How
  to Make Dialogs.



  The JDialog component contains a JRootPane
  as its only child.
  The contentPane should be the parent of any children of the
  JDialog.
  As a convenience, the add, remove, and setLayout
  methods of this class are overridden, so that they delegate calls
  to the corresponding methods of the ContentPane.
  For example, you can add a child component to a dialog as follows:


        dialog.add(child);
  And the child will be added to the contentPane.
  The contentPane is always non-null.
  Attempting to set it to null generates an exception.
  The default contentPane has a BorderLayout
  manager set on it.
  Refer to RootPaneContainer
  for details on adding, removing and setting the LayoutManager
  of a JDialog.

  Please see the JRootPane documentation for a complete
  description of the contentPane, glassPane,
  and layeredPane components.

  In a multi-screen environment, you can create a JDialog
  on a different screen device than its owner.  See Frame for
  more information.

  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
  information see Swing's Threading
  Policy.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."

(defn ->j-dialog
  "Constructor.

  Creates a dialog with the specified title,
   owner Frame, modality and GraphicsConfiguration.
   If owner is null,
   a shared, hidden frame will be set as the owner of this dialog.

   This constructor sets the component's locale property to the value
   returned by JComponent.getDefaultLocale.

   NOTE: Any popup components (JComboBox,
   JPopupMenu, JMenuBar)
   created within a modal dialog will be forced to be lightweight.

   NOTE: This constructor does not allow you to create an unowned
   JDialog. To create an unowned JDialog
   you must use either the JDialog(Window) or
   JDialog(Dialog) constructor with an argument of
   null.

  owner - the Frame from which the dialog is displayed - `java.awt.Frame`
  title - the String to display in the dialog's title bar - `java.lang.String`
  modal - specifies whether dialog blocks user input to other top-level windows when shown. If true, the modality type property is set to DEFAULT_MODALITY_TYPE, otherwise the dialog is modeless. - `boolean`
  gc - the GraphicsConfiguration of the target screen device; if null, the default system GraphicsConfiguration is assumed - `java.awt.GraphicsConfiguration`

(defn *set-default-look-and-feel-decorated
  "Provides a hint as to whether or not newly created JDialogs

   decorations, and the current window manager supports undecorated
   windows, then newly created JDialogs will have their
   Window decorations provided by the current LookAndFeel.
   Otherwise, newly created JDialogs will have their
   Window decorations provided by the current window manager.

   You can get the same effect on a single JDialog by doing the following:
