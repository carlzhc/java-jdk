(ns javax.swing.JTree
  " A control that displays a set of hierarchical data as an outline.
  You can find task-oriented documentation and examples of using trees in
  How to Use Trees,
  a section in The Java Tutorial.

  A specific node in a tree can be identified either by a
  TreePath (an object
  that encapsulates a node and all of its ancestors), or by its
  display row, where each row in the display area displays one node.
  An expanded node is a non-leaf node (as identified by
  TreeModel.isLeaf(node) returning false) that will displays
  its children when all its ancestors are expanded.
  A collapsed
  node is one which hides them. A hidden node is one which is
  under a collapsed ancestor. All of a viewable nodes parents
  are expanded, but may or may not be displayed. A displayed node
  is both viewable and in the display area, where it can be seen.

  The following JTree methods use \"visible\" to mean \"displayed\":

  isRootVisible()
  setRootVisible()
  scrollPathToVisible()
  scrollRowToVisible()
  getVisibleRowCount()
  setVisibleRowCount()

  The next group of JTree methods use \"visible\" to mean
  \"viewable\" (under an expanded parent):

  isVisible()
  makeVisible()

  If you are interested in knowing when the selection changes implement
  the TreeSelectionListener interface and add the instance
  using the method addTreeSelectionListener.
  valueChanged will be invoked when the
  selection changes, that is if the user clicks twice on the same
  node valueChanged will only be invoked once.

  If you are interested in detecting either double-click events or when
  a user clicks on a node, regardless of whether or not it was selected,
  we recommend you do the following:



  final JTree tree = ...;

  MouseListener ml = new MouseAdapter() {
      public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
          int selRow = tree.getRowForLocation(e.getX(), e.getY());
          TreePath selPath = tree.getPathForLocation(e.getX(), e.getY());
          if(selRow != -1) {
              if(e.getClickCount() == 1) {
                  mySingleClick(selRow, selPath);
              }
              else if(e.getClickCount() == 2) {
                  myDoubleClick(selRow, selPath);
              }
          }
      }
  };
  tree.addMouseListener(ml);
  NOTE: This example obtains both the path and row, but you only need to
  get the one you're interested in.

  To use JTree to display compound nodes
  (for example, nodes containing both
  a graphic icon and text), subclass TreeCellRenderer and use
  setCellRenderer(javax.swing.tree.TreeCellRenderer) to tell the tree to use it. To edit such nodes,
  subclass TreeCellEditor and use setCellEditor(javax.swing.tree.TreeCellEditor).


  Like all JComponent classes, you can use InputMap and
  ActionMap
  to associate an Action object with a KeyStroke
  and execute the action under specified conditions.
