(ns javax.swing.CellRendererPane
  "This class is inserted in between cell renderers and the components that
  use them.  It just exists to thwart the repaint() and invalidate() methods
  which would otherwise propagate up the tree when the renderer was configured.
  It's used by the implementations of JTable, JTree, and JList.  For example,
  here's how CellRendererPane is used in the code the paints each row
  in a JList:


    cellRendererPane = new CellRendererPane();
    ...
    Component rendererComponent = renderer.getListCellRendererComponent();
    renderer.configureListCellRenderer(dataModel.getElementAt(row), row);
    cellRendererPane.paintComponent(g, rendererComponent, this, x, y, w, h);

  A renderer component must override isShowing() and unconditionally return
  true to work correctly because the Swing paint does nothing for components
  with isShowing false.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."

   the component is painted it's bounds are reset to -w, -h, 0, 0 so that, if
