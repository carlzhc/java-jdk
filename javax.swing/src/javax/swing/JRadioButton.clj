(ns javax.swing.JRadioButton
  "An implementation of a radio button -- an item that can be selected or
  deselected, and which displays its state to the user.
  Used with a ButtonGroup object to create a group of buttons
  in which only one button at a time can be selected. (Create a ButtonGroup
  object and use its add method to include the JRadioButton objects
  in the group.)

  Note:
  The ButtonGroup object is a logical grouping -- not a physical grouping.
  To create a button panel, you should still create a JPanel or similar
  container-object and add a Border to it to set it off from surrounding
  components.


  Buttons can be configured, and to some degree controlled, by
  Actions.  Using an
  Action with a button has many benefits beyond directly
  configuring a button.  Refer to
  Swing Components Supporting Action for more
  details, and you can find more information in How
  to Use Actions, a section in The Java Tutorial.

  See How to Use Buttons, Check Boxes, and Radio Buttons
  in The Java Tutorial
  for further documentation.

  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
  information see Swing's Threading
  Policy.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."
