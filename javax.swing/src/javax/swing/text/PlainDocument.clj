(ns javax.swing.text.PlainDocument
  "A plain document that maintains no character attributes.  The
  default element structure for this document is a map of the lines in
  the text.  The Element returned by getDefaultRootElement is
  a map of the lines, and each child element represents a line.
  This model does not maintain any character level attributes,
  but each line can be tagged with an arbitrary set of attributes.
  Line to offset, and offset to line translations can be quickly
  performed using the default root element.  The structure information
  of the DocumentEvent's fired by edits will indicate the line
  structure changes.

  The default content storage management is performed by a
  gapped buffer implementation (GapContent).  It supports
  editing reasonably large documents with good efficiency when
  the edits are contiguous or clustered, as is typical.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."
