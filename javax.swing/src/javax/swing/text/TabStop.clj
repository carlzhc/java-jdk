(ns javax.swing.text.TabStop
  "This class encapsulates a single tab stop (basically as tab stops
  are thought of by RTF). A tab stop is at a specified distance from the
  left margin, aligns text in a specified way, and has a specified leader.
  TabStops are immutable, and usually contained in TabSets.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."
