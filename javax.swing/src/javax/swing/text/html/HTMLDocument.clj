(ns javax.swing.text.html.HTMLDocument
  "A document that models HTML.  The purpose of this model is to
  support both browsing and editing.  As a result, the structure
  described by an HTML document is not exactly replicated by default.
  The element structure that is modeled by default, is built by the
  class HTMLDocument.HTMLReader, which implements the
  HTMLEditorKit.ParserCallback protocol that the parser
  expects.  To change the structure one can subclass
  HTMLReader, and reimplement the method getReader(int) to return the new reader implementation.  The
  documentation for HTMLReader should be consulted for
  the details of the default structure created.  The intent is that
  the document be non-lossy (although reproducing the HTML format may
  result in a different format).

  The document models only HTML, and makes no attempt to store
  view attributes in it.  The elements are identified by the
  StyleContext.NameAttribute attribute, which should
  always have a value of type HTML.Tag that identifies
  the kind of element.  Some of the elements (such as comments) are
  synthesized.  The HTMLFactory uses this attribute to
  determine what kind of view to build.

  This document supports incremental loading.  The
  TokenThreshold property controls how much of the parse
  is buffered before trying to update the element structure of the
  document.  This property is set by the EditorKit so
  that subclasses can disable it.

  The Base property determines the URL against which
  relative URLs are resolved.  By default, this will be the
  Document.StreamDescriptionProperty if the value of the
  property is a URL.  If a <BASE> tag is encountered, the base
  will become the URL specified by that tag.  Because the base URL is
  a property, it can of course be set directly.

  The default content storage mechanism for this document is a gap
  buffer (GapContent).  Alternatives can be supplied by
  using the constructor that takes a Content
  implementation.

  Modifying HTMLDocument

  In addition to the methods provided by Document and
  StyledDocument for mutating an HTMLDocument, HTMLDocument provides
  a number of convenience methods.  The following methods can be used
  to insert HTML content into an existing document.


    setInnerHTML(Element, String)
    setOuterHTML(Element, String)
    insertBeforeStart(Element, String)
    insertAfterStart(Element, String)
    insertBeforeEnd(Element, String)
    insertAfterEnd(Element, String)


  The following examples illustrate using these methods.  Each
  example assumes the HTML document is initialized in the following
  way:



  JEditorPane p = new JEditorPane();
  p.setContentType(\"text/html\");
  p.setText(\"...\"); // Document text is provided below.
  HTMLDocument d = (HTMLDocument) p.getDocument();

  With the following HTML content:



  <html>
    <head>
      <title>An example HTMLDocument</title>
      <style type=\"text/css\">
        div { background-color: silver; }
        ul { color: red; }
      </style>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id=\"BOX\">
        <p>Paragraph 1</p>
        <p>Paragraph 2</p>
      </div>
    </body>
  </html>

  All the methods for modifying an HTML document require an Element.  Elements can be obtained from an HTML document by using
  the method getElement(Element e, Object attribute, Object
  value).  It returns the first descendant element that contains the
  specified attribute with the given value, in depth-first order.
  For example, d.getElement(d.getDefaultRootElement(),
  StyleConstants.NameAttribute, HTML.Tag.P) returns the first
  paragraph element.

  A convenient shortcut for locating elements is the method getElement(String); returns an element whose ID
  attribute matches the specified value.  For example,
  d.getElement(\"BOX\") returns the DIV
  element.

  The getIterator(HTML.Tag t) method can also be used for
  finding all occurrences of the specified HTML tag in the
  document.

  Inserting elements

  Elements can be inserted before or after the existing children
  of any non-leaf element by using the methods
  insertAfterStart and insertBeforeEnd.
  For example, if e is the DIV element,
  d.insertAfterStart(e, \"<ul><li>List
  Item</li></ul>\") inserts the list before the first
  paragraph, and d.insertBeforeEnd(e, \"<ul><li>List
  Item</li></ul>\") inserts the list after the last
  paragraph.  The DIV block becomes the parent of the
  newly inserted elements.

  Sibling elements can be inserted before or after any element by
  using the methods insertBeforeStart and
  insertAfterEnd.  For example, if e is the
  DIV element, d.insertBeforeStart(e,
  \"<ul><li>List Item</li></ul>\") inserts the list
  before the DIV element, and d.insertAfterEnd(e,
  \"<ul><li>List Item</li></ul>\") inserts the list
  after the DIV element.  The newly inserted elements
  become siblings of the DIV element.

  Replacing elements

  Elements and all their descendants can be replaced by using the
  methods setInnerHTML and setOuterHTML.
  For example, if e is the DIV element,
  d.setInnerHTML(e, \"<ul><li>List
  Item</li></ul>\") replaces all children paragraphs with
  the list, and d.setOuterHTML(e, \"<ul><li>List
  Item</li></ul>\") replaces the DIV element
  itself.  In latter case the parent of the list is the
  BODY element.

  The following table shows the example document and the results
  of various methods described above.
