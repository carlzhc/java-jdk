(ns javax.swing.text.AbstractDocument
  "An implementation of the document interface to serve as a
  basis for implementing various kinds of documents.  At this
  level there is very little policy, so there is a corresponding
  increase in difficulty of use.

  This class implements a locking mechanism for the document.  It
  allows multiple readers or one writer, and writers must wait until
  all observers of the document have been notified of a previous
  change before beginning another mutation to the document.  The
  read lock is acquired and released using the render
  method.  A write lock is acquired by the methods that mutate the
  document, and are held for the duration of the method call.
  Notification is done on the thread that produced the mutation,
  and the thread has full read access to the document for the
  duration of the notification, but other readers are kept out
  until the notification has finished.  The notification is a
  beans event notification which does not allow any further
  mutations until all listeners have been notified.

  Any models subclassed from this class and used in conjunction
  with a text component that has a look and feel implementation
  that is derived from BasicTextUI may be safely updated
  asynchronously, because all access to the View hierarchy
  is serialized by BasicTextUI if the document is of type
  AbstractDocument.  The locking assumes that an
  independent thread will access the View hierarchy only from
  the DocumentListener methods, and that there will be only
  one event thread active at a time.

  If concurrency support is desired, there are the following
  additional implications.  The code path for any DocumentListener
  implementation and any UndoListener implementation must be threadsafe,
  and not access the component lock if trying to be safe from deadlocks.
  The repaint and revalidate methods
  on JComponent are safe.

  AbstractDocument models an implied break at the end of the document.
  Among other things this allows you to position the caret after the last
  character. As a result of this, getLength returns one less
  than the length of the Content. If you create your own Content, be
  sure and initialize it to have an additional character. Refer to
  StringContent and GapContent for examples of this. Another implication
  of this is that Elements that model the implied end character will have
  an endOffset == (getLength()  1). For example, in DefaultStyledDocument
  getParagraphElement(getLength()).getEndOffset() == getLength()  1
  .

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
