(ns javax.swing.text.DefaultCaret
  "A default implementation of Caret.  The caret is rendered as
  a vertical line in the color specified by the CaretColor property
  of the associated JTextComponent.  It can blink at the rate specified
  by the BlinkRate property.

  This implementation expects two sources of asynchronous notification.
  The timer thread fires asynchronously, and causes the caret to simply
  repaint the most recent bounding box.  The caret also tracks change
  as the document is modified.  Typically this will happen on the
  event dispatch thread as a result of some mouse or keyboard event.
  The caret behavior on both synchronous and asynchronous documents updates
  is controlled by UpdatePolicy property. The repaint of the
  new caret location will occur on the event thread in any case, as calls to
  modelToView are only safe on the event thread.

  The caret acts as a mouse and focus listener on the text component
  it has been installed in, and defines the caret semantics based upon
  those events.  The listener methods can be reimplemented to change the
  semantics.
  By default, the first mouse button will be used to set focus and caret
  position.  Dragging the mouse pointer with the first mouse button will
  sweep out a selection that is contiguous in the model.  If the associated
  text component is editable, the caret will become visible when focus
  is gained, and invisible when focus is lost.

  The Highlighter bound to the associated text component is used to
  render the selection by default.
  Selection appearance can be customized by supplying a
  painter to use for the highlights.  By default a painter is used that
  will render a solid color as specified in the associated text component
  in the SelectionColor property.  This can easily be changed
  by reimplementing the
  getSelectionPainter
  method.

  A customized caret appearance can be achieved by reimplementing
  the paint method.  If the paint method is changed, the damage method
  should also be reimplemented to cause a repaint for the area needed
  to render the caret.  The caret extends the Rectangle class which
  is used to hold the bounding box for where the caret was last rendered.
  This enables the caret to repaint in a thread-safe manner when the
  caret moves without making a call to modelToView which is unstable
  between model updates and view repair (i.e. the order of delivery
  to DocumentListeners is not guaranteed).

  The magic caret position is set to null when the caret position changes.
  A timer is used to determine the new location (after the caret change).
  When the timer fires, if the magic caret position is still null it is
  reset to the current caret position. Any actions that change
  the caret position and want the magic caret position to remain the
  same, must remember the magic caret position, change the cursor, and
  then set the magic caret position to its original value. This has the
  benefit that only actions that want the magic caret position to persist
  (such as open/down) need to know about it.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.

(defn set-update-policy
  "Sets the caret movement policy on the document updates. Normally
   the caret updates its absolute position within the document on
   insertions occurred before or at the caret position and
   on removals before the caret position. 'Absolute position'
   means here the position relative to the start of the document.
   For example if
   a character is typed within editable text component it is inserted
   at the caret position and the caret moves to the next absolute
   position within the document due to insertion and if
   BACKSPACE is typed then caret decreases its absolute
   position due to removal of a character before it. Sometimes
   it may be useful to turn off the caret position updates so that
   the caret stays at the same absolute position within the
   document position regardless of any document updates.

   The following update policies are allowed:

     NEVER_UPDATE: the caret stays at the same
         absolute position in the document regardless of any document
         updates, except when document length becomes less than
         the current caret position due to removal. In that case caret
         position is adjusted to the end of the document.
         The caret doesn't try to keep itself visible by scrolling
         the associated view when using this policy.
     ALWAYS_UPDATE: the caret always tracks document
         changes. For regular changes it increases its position
         if an insertion occurs before or at its current position,
         and decreases position if a removal occurs before
         its current position. For undo/redo updates it is always
         moved to the position where update occurred. The caret
         also tries to keep itself visible by calling
         adjustVisibility method.
     UPDATE_WHEN_ON_EDT: acts like ALWAYS_UPDATE
