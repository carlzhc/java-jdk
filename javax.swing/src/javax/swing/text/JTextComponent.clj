(ns javax.swing.text.JTextComponent
  "JTextComponent is the base class for swing text
  components.  It tries to be compatible with the
  java.awt.TextComponent class
  where it can reasonably do so.  Also provided are other services
  for additional flexibility (beyond the pluggable UI and bean
  support).
  You can find information on how to use the functionality
  this class provides in
  General Rules for Using Text Components,
  a section in The Java Tutorial.


  Caret Changes

  The caret is a pluggable object in swing text components.
  Notification of changes to the caret position and the selection
  are sent to implementations of the CaretListener
  interface that have been registered with the text component.
  The UI will install a default caret unless a customized caret
  has been set.
  By default the caret tracks all the document changes
  performed on the Event Dispatching Thread and updates it's position
  accordingly if an insertion occurs before or at the caret position
  or a removal occurs before the caret position. DefaultCaret
  tries to make itself visible which may lead to scrolling
  of a text component within JScrollPane. The default caret
  behavior can be changed by the DefaultCaret.setUpdatePolicy(int) method.

  Note: Non-editable text components also have a caret though
  it may not be painted.

  Commands

  Text components provide a number of commands that can be used
  to manipulate the component.  This is essentially the way that
  the component expresses its capabilities.  These are expressed
  in terms of the swing Action interface,
  using the TextAction implementation.
  The set of commands supported by the text component can be
  found with the getActions() method.  These actions
  can be bound to key events, fired from buttons, etc.

  Text Input

  The text components support flexible and internationalized text input, using
  keymaps and the input method framework, while maintaining compatibility with
  the AWT listener model.

  A Keymap lets an application bind key
  strokes to actions.
  In order to allow keymaps to be shared across multiple text components, they
  can use actions that extend TextAction.
  TextAction can determine which JTextComponent
  most recently has or had focus and therefore is the subject of
  the action (In the case that the ActionEvent
  sent to the action doesn't contain the target text component as its source).

  The input method framework
  lets text components interact with input methods, separate software
  components that preprocess events to let users enter thousands of
  different characters using keyboards with far fewer keys.
  JTextComponent is an active client of
  the framework, so it implements the preferred user interface for interacting
  with input methods. As a consequence, some key events do not reach the text
  component because they are handled by an input method, and some text input
  reaches the text component as committed text within an InputMethodEvent instead of as a key event.
  The complete text input is the combination of the characters in
  keyTyped key events and committed text in input method events.

  The AWT listener model lets applications attach event listeners to
  components in order to bind events to actions. Swing encourages the
  use of keymaps instead of listeners, but maintains compatibility
  with listeners by giving the listeners a chance to steal an event
  by consuming it.

  Keyboard event and input method events are handled in the following stages,
  with each stage capable of consuming the event:



  Stage
  KeyEvent
  InputMethodEvent
  1.
      input methods
      (generated here)
  2.
      focus manager



      3.
      registered key listeners
      registered input method listeners

      4.

      input method handling in JTextComponent

      5.   keymap handling using the current keymap
  6.   keyboard handling in JComponent (e.g. accelerators, component navigation, etc.)




  To maintain compatibility with applications that listen to key
  events but are not aware of input method events, the input
  method handling in stage 4 provides a compatibility mode for
  components that do not process input method events. For these
  components, the committed text is converted to keyTyped key events
  and processed in the key event pipeline starting at stage 3
  instead of in the input method event pipeline.

  By default the component will create a keymap (named DEFAULT_KEYMAP)
  that is shared by all JTextComponent instances as the default keymap.
  Typically a look-and-feel implementation will install a different keymap
  that resolves to the default keymap for those bindings not found in the
  different keymap. The minimal bindings include:

  inserting content into the editor for the
   printable keys.
  removing content with the backspace and del
   keys.
  caret movement forward and backward


  Model/View Split

  The text components have a model-view split.  A text component pulls
  together the objects used to represent the model, view, and controller.
  The text document model may be shared by other views which act as observers
  of the model (e.g. a document may be shared by multiple components).




  The model is defined by the Document interface.
  This is intended to provide a flexible text storage mechanism
  that tracks change during edits and can be extended to more sophisticated
  models.  The model interfaces are meant to capture the capabilities of
  expression given by SGML, a system used to express a wide variety of
  content.
  Each modification to the document causes notification of the
  details of the change to be sent to all observers in the form of a
  DocumentEvent which allows the views to stay up to date with the model.
  This event is sent to observers that have implemented the
  DocumentListener
  interface and registered interest with the model being observed.

  Location Information

  The capability of determining the location of text in
  the view is provided.  There are two methods, modelToView(int)
  and viewToModel(java.awt.Point) for determining this information.

  Undo/Redo support

  Support for an edit history mechanism is provided to allow
  undo/redo operations.  The text component does not itself
  provide the history buffer by default, but does provide
  the UndoableEdit records that can be used in conjunction
  with a history buffer to provide the undo/redo support.
  The support is provided by the Document model, which allows
  one to attach UndoableEditListener implementations.

  Thread Safety

  The swing text components provide some support of thread
  safe operations.  Because of the high level of configurability
  of the text components, it is possible to circumvent the
  protection provided.  The protection primarily comes from
  the model, so the documentation of AbstractDocument
  describes the assumptions of the protection provided.
  The methods that are safe to call asynchronously are marked
  with comments.

  Newlines

  For a discussion on how newlines are handled, see
  DefaultEditorKit.


  Printing support

  Several print methods are provided for basic
  document printing.  If more advanced printing is needed, use the
  getPrintable(java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat) method.



  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.

(defn print
  "Prints the content of this JTextComponent. Note: this method

   Page header and footer text can be added to the output by providing
   MessageFormat arguments. The printing code requests
   Strings from the formats, providing a single item which may be
   included in the formatted string: an Integer representing the
   current page number.


   showPrintDialog boolean parameter allows you to specify whether
   a print dialog is displayed to the user. When it is, the user
   may use the dialog to change printing attributes or even cancel the
   print.


   service allows you to provide the initial
   PrintService for the print dialog, or to specify
   PrintService to print to when the dialog is not shown.


   attributes can be used to provide the
   initial values for the print dialog, or to supply any needed
   attributes when the dialog is not shown. attributes can
   be used to control how the job will print, for example
   duplex or single-sided.


   interactive boolean parameter allows you to specify
   whether to perform printing in interactive
   mode. If true, a progress dialog, with an abort option,
   is displayed for the duration of printing.  This dialog is
   modal when print is invoked on the Event Dispatch
   Thread and non-modal otherwise. Warning:
   calling this method on the Event Dispatch Thread with interactive false blocks all events, including repaints, from
   being processed until printing is complete. It is only
   recommended when printing from an application with no
   visible GUI.


   Note: In headless mode, showPrintDialog and
   interactive parameters are ignored and no dialogs are
   shown.


   This method ensures the document is not mutated during printing.
   To indicate it visually, setEnabled(false) is set for the
   duration of printing.


   This method uses getPrintable(java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat) to render document content.


   This method is thread-safe, although most Swing methods are not. Please
   see
   Concurrency in Swing for more information.


   Sample Usage. This code snippet shows a cross-platform print
   dialog and then prints the JTextComponent in interactive mode
   unless the user cancels the dialog:



   textComponent.print(new MessageFormat(`My text component header`),
       new MessageFormat(`Footer. Page - {0}`), true, null, null, true);

   Executing this code off the Event Dispatch Thread
   performs printing on the background.
   The following pattern might be used for background
   printing:


       FutureTask<Boolean> future =
           new FutureTask<Boolean>(
               new Callable<Boolean>() {
                   public Boolean call() {
                       return textComponent.print(.....);
