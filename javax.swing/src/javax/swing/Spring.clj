(ns javax.swing.Spring
  "An instance of the Spring class holds three properties that
   characterize its behavior: the minimum, preferred, and
   maximum values. Each of these properties may be involved in
   defining its fourth, value, property based on a series of rules.

   An instance of the Spring class can be visualized as a
   mechanical spring that provides a corrective force as the spring is compressed
   or stretched away from its preferred value. This force is modelled
   as linear function of the distance from the preferred value, but with
   two different constants -- one for the compressional force and one for the
   tensional one. Those constants are specified by the minimum and maximum
   values of the spring such that a spring at its minimum value produces an
   equal and opposite force to that which is created when it is at its
   maximum value. The difference between the preferred and
   minimum values, therefore, represents the ease with which the
   spring can be compressed and the difference between its maximum
   and preferred values, indicates the ease with which the
   Spring can be extended.
   See the sum(javax.swing.Spring, javax.swing.Spring) method for details.


   By defining simple arithmetic operations on Springs,
   the behavior of a collection of Springs
   can be reduced to that of an ordinary (non-compound) Spring. We define
   the `+`, `-`, max, and min operators on
   Springs so that, in each case, the result is a Spring
   whose characteristics bear a useful mathematical relationship to its constituent
   springs.


   A Spring can be treated as a pair of intervals
   with a single common point: the preferred value.
   The following rules define some of the
   arithmetic operators that can be applied to intervals
   ([a, b] refers to the interval
   from a
   to b,
   where a <= b).



           [a1, b1]  [a2, b2] = [a1  a2, b1  b2]

                       -[a, b] = [-b, -a]

       max([a1, b1], [a2, b2]) = [max(a1, a2), max(b1, b2)]


   If we denote Springs as [a, b, c],
   where a <= b <= c, we can define the same
   arithmetic operators on Springs:



           [a1, b1, c1]  [a2, b2, c2] = [a1  a2, b1  b2, c1  c2]

                            -[a, b, c] = [-c, -b, -a]

       max([a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]) = [max(a1, a2), max(b1, b2), max(c1, c2)]

   With both intervals and Springs we can define `-` and min
   in terms of negation:



       X - Y = X  (-Y)

       min(X, Y) = -max(-X, -Y)

   For the static methods in this class that embody the arithmetic
   operators, we do not actually perform the operation in question as
   that would snapshot the values of the properties of the method's arguments
   at the time the static method is called. Instead, the static methods
   create a new Spring instance containing references to
   the method's arguments so that the characteristics of the new spring track the
   potentially changing characteristics of the springs from which it
   was made. This is a little like the idea of a lazy value
   in a functional language.

  If you are implementing a SpringLayout you
  can find further information and examples in
  How to Use SpringLayout,

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.

   The strain of a spring in compression is:

   the sum is known, the values of s1 and s2 are
   then set so that they are have a strain equal to that of the sum. The formulas are
