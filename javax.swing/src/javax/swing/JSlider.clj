(ns javax.swing.JSlider
  "A component that lets the user graphically select a value by sliding
  a knob within a bounded interval. The knob is always positioned
  at the points that match integer values within the specified interval.

  The slider can show both
  major tick marks, and minor tick marks between the major ones.  The number of
  values between the tick marks is controlled with
  setMajorTickSpacing and setMinorTickSpacing.
  Painting of tick marks is controlled by setPaintTicks.

  Sliders can also print text labels at regular intervals (or at
  arbitrary locations) along the slider track.  Painting of labels is
  controlled by setLabelTable and setPaintLabels.

  For further information and examples see
  How to Use Sliders,
  a section in The Java Tutorial.
