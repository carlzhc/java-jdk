  "The JTable is used to display and edit regular two-dimensional tables
  of cells.
  See How to Use Tables
  in The Java Tutorial
  for task-oriented documentation and examples of using JTable.


  The JTable has many
  facilities that make it possible to customize its rendering and editing
  but provides defaults for these features so that simple tables can be
  set up easily.  For example, to set up a table with 10 rows and 10
  columns of numbers:



       TableModel dataModel = new AbstractTableModel() {
           public int getColumnCount() { return 10; }
           public int getRowCount() { return 10;}
           public Object getValueAt(int row, int col) { return new Integer(row*col); }
       };
       JTable table = new JTable(dataModel);
       JScrollPane scrollpane = new JScrollPane(table);

  JTables are typically placed inside of a JScrollPane.  By
  default, a JTable will adjust its width such that
  a horizontal scrollbar is unnecessary.  To allow for a horizontal scrollbar,
  invoke setAutoResizeMode(int) with AUTO_RESIZE_OFF.
  Note that if you wish to use a JTable in a standalone
  view (outside of a JScrollPane) and want the header
  displayed, you can get it using getTableHeader() and
  display it separately.

  To enable sorting and filtering of rows, use a
  RowSorter.
  You can set up a row sorter in either of two ways:

    Directly set the RowSorter. For example:
         table.setRowSorter(new TableRowSorter(model)).
    Set the autoCreateRowSorter
        property to true, so that the JTable
        creates a RowSorter for
        you. For example: setAutoCreateRowSorter(true).


  When designing applications that use the JTable it is worth paying
  close attention to the data structures that will represent the table's data.
  The DefaultTableModel is a model implementation that
  uses a Vector of Vectors of Objects to
  store the cell values. As well as copying the data from an
  application into the DefaultTableModel,
  it is also possible to wrap the data in the methods of the
  TableModel interface so that the data can be passed to the
  JTable directly, as in the example above. This often results
  in more efficient applications because the model is free to choose the
  internal representation that best suits the data.
  A good rule of thumb for deciding whether to use the AbstractTableModel
  or the DefaultTableModel is to use the AbstractTableModel
  as the base class for creating subclasses and the DefaultTableModel
  when subclassing is not required.

  The `TableExample` directory in the demo area of the source distribution
  gives a number of complete examples of JTable usage,
  covering how the JTable can be used to provide an
  editable view of data taken from a database and how to modify
  the columns in the display to use specialized renderers and editors.

  The JTable uses integers exclusively to refer to both the rows and the columns
  of the model that it displays. The JTable simply takes a tabular range of cells
  and uses getValueAt(int, int) to retrieve the
  values from the model during painting.  It is important to remember that
  the column and row indexes returned by various JTable methods
  are in terms of the JTable (the view) and are not
  necessarily the same indexes used by the model.

  By default, columns may be rearranged in the JTable so that the
  view's columns appear in a different order to the columns in the model.
  This does not affect the implementation of the model at all: when the
  columns are reordered, the JTable maintains the new order of the columns
  internally and converts its column indices before querying the model.

  So, when writing a TableModel, it is not necessary to listen for column
  reordering events as the model will be queried in its own coordinate
  system regardless of what is happening in the view.
  In the examples area there is a demonstration of a sorting algorithm making
  use of exactly this technique to interpose yet another coordinate system
  where the order of the rows is changed, rather than the order of the columns.

  Similarly when using the sorting and filtering functionality
  provided by RowSorter the underlying
  TableModel does not need to know how to do sorting,
  rather RowSorter will handle it.  Coordinate
  conversions will be necessary when using the row based methods of
  JTable with the underlying TableModel.
  All of JTables row based methods are in terms of the
  RowSorter, which is not necessarily the same as that
  of the underlying TableModel.  For example, the
  selection is always in terms of JTable so that when
  using RowSorter you will need to convert using
  convertRowIndexToView or
  convertRowIndexToModel.  The following shows how to
  convert coordinates from JTable to that of the
  underlying model:


    int[] selection = table.getSelectedRows();
    for (int i = 0; i < selection.length; i++) {
      selection[i] = table.convertRowIndexToModel(selection[i]);
    }
    // selection is now in terms of the underlying TableModel

  By default if sorting is enabled JTable will persist the
  selection and variable row heights in terms of the model on
  sorting.  For example if row 0, in terms of the underlying model,
  is currently selected, after the sort row 0, in terms of the
  underlying model will be selected.  Visually the selection may
  change, but in terms of the underlying model it will remain the
  same.  The one exception to that is if the model index is no longer
  visible or was removed.  For example, if row 0 in terms of model
  was filtered out the selection will be empty after the sort.

  J2SE 5 adds methods to JTable to provide convenient access to some
  common printing needs. Simple new print() methods allow for quick
  and easy addition of printing support to your application. In addition, a new
  getPrintable(javax.swing.JTable.PrintMode, java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat) method is available for more advanced printing needs.

  As for all JComponent classes, you can use
  InputMap and ActionMap to associate an
  Action object with a KeyStroke and execute the
  action under specified conditions.

  "Causes this table to lay out its rows and columns.  Overridden so

   a containing parent.
   Resizes one or more of the columns in the table
   so that the total width of all of this JTable's
   columns is equal to the width of the table.

   Before the layout begins the method gets the
   resizingColumn of the tableHeader.
   When the method is called as a result of the resizing of an enclosing window,
   the resizingColumn is null. This means that resizing
   has taken place `outside` the JTable and the change -
   or `delta` - should be distributed to all of the columns regardless
   of this JTable's automatic resize mode.

   If the resizingColumn is not null, it is one of
   the columns in the table that has changed size rather than
   the table itself. In this case the auto-resize modes govern
   the way the extra (or deficit) space is distributed
   amongst the available columns.

   The modes are:

     AUTO_RESIZE_OFF: Don't automatically adjust the column's
   widths at all. Use a horizontal scrollbar to accommodate the
   columns when their sum exceeds the width of the
   Viewport.  If the JTable is not
   enclosed in a JScrollPane this may
   leave parts of the table invisible.
     AUTO_RESIZE_NEXT_COLUMN: Use just the column after the
   resizing column. This results in the `boundary` or divider
   between adjacent cells being independently adjustable.
     AUTO_RESIZE_SUBSEQUENT_COLUMNS: Use all columns after the
   one being adjusted to absorb the changes.  This is the
   default behavior.
     AUTO_RESIZE_LAST_COLUMN: Automatically adjust the
   size of the last column only. If the bounds of the last column
   prevent the desired size from being allocated, set the
   width of the last column to the appropriate limit and make
   no further adjustments.
     AUTO_RESIZE_ALL_COLUMNS: Spread the delta amongst all the columns
   in the JTable, including the one that is being
   adjusted.


   Note: When a JTable makes adjustments
     to the widths of the columns it respects their minimum and
     maximum values absolutely.  It is therefore possible that,
     even after this method is called, the total width of the columns
     is still not equal to the width of the table. When this happens
     the JTable does not put itself
     in AUTO_RESIZE_OFF mode to bring up a scroll bar, or break other
     commitments of its current auto-resize mode -- instead it
     allows its bounds to be set larger (or smaller) than the total of the
     column minimum or maximum, meaning, either that there
     will not be enough room to display all of the columns, or that the
     columns will not fill the JTable's bounds.
     These respectively, result in the clipping of some columns
     or an area being painted in the JTable's
     background color during painting.

     The mechanism for distributing the delta amongst the available
     columns is provided in a private method in the JTable
     class:


     adjustSizes(long targetSize, final Resizable3 r, boolean inverse)
     an explanation of which is provided in the following section.
     Resizable3 is a private
     interface that allows any data structure containing a collection
     of elements with a size, preferred size, maximum size and minimum size
     to have its elements manipulated by the algorithm.

    Distributing the delta

    Overview

   Call `DELTA` the difference between the target size and the
   sum of the preferred sizes of the elements in r. The individual
   sizes are calculated by taking the original preferred
   sizes and adding a share of the DELTA - that share being based on
   how far each preferred size is from its limiting bound (minimum or
   maximum).

   Definition

   Call the individual constraints min[i], max[i], and pref[i].

   Call their respective sums: MIN, MAX, and PREF.

   Each new size will be calculated using:



            size[i] = pref[i]  delta[i]
   where each individual delta[i] is calculated according to:

   If (DELTA < 0) we are in shrink mode where:



                          DELTA
            delta[i] = ------------ * (pref[i] - min[i])
                       (PREF - MIN)
   If (DELTA > 0) we are in expand mode where:



                          DELTA
            delta[i] = ------------ * (max[i] - pref[i])
                        (MAX - PREF)

   The overall effect is that the total size moves that same percentage,
   k, towards the total minimum or maximum and that percentage guarantees
   accommodation of the required space, DELTA.

   Naive evaluation of the formulae presented here would be subject to
   the aggregated rounding errors caused by doing this operation in finite
   precision (using ints). To deal with this, the multiplying factor above,
   is constantly recalculated and this takes account of the rounding
   errors in the previous iterations. The result is an algorithm that
   produces a set of integers whose values exactly sum to the supplied
   targetSize, and does so by spreading the rounding
   errors evenly over the given elements.

   When the MAX and MIN bounds are hit

   When targetSize is outside the [MIN, MAX] range,
   the algorithm sets all sizes to their appropriate limiting value

(defn print
  "Prints this JTable. Takes steps that the majority of

   In short, it prepares the table, calls getPrintable to
   fetch an appropriate Printable, and then sends it to the
   printer.

   A boolean parameter allows you to specify whether or not
   a printing dialog is displayed to the user. When it is, the user may
   use the dialog to change the destination printer or printing attributes,
   or even to cancel the print. Another two parameters allow for a
   PrintService and printing attributes to be specified.
   These parameters can be used either to provide initial values for the
   print dialog, or to specify values when the dialog is not shown.

   A second boolean parameter allows you to specify whether
   or not to perform printing in an interactive mode. If true,
   a modal progress dialog, with an abort option, is displayed for the
   duration of printing . This dialog also prevents any user action which
   may affect the table. However, it can not prevent the table from being
   modified by code (for example, another thread that posts updates using
   SwingUtilities.invokeLater). It is therefore the
   responsibility of the developer to ensure that no other code modifies
   the table in any way during printing (invalid modifications include
   changes in: size, renderers, or underlying data). Printing behavior is
   undefined when the table is changed during printing.

   If false is specified for this parameter, no dialog will
   be displayed and printing will begin immediately on the event-dispatch
   thread. This blocks any other events, including repaints, from being
   processed until printing is complete. Although this effectively prevents
   the table from being changed, it doesn't provide a good user experience.
   For this reason, specifying false is only recommended when
   printing from an application with no visible GUI.

   Note: Attempting to show the printing dialog or run interactively, while
   in headless mode, will result in a HeadlessException.

   Before fetching the printable, this method will gracefully terminate
   editing, if necessary, to prevent an editor from showing in the printed
   result. Additionally, JTable will prepare its renderers
   during printing such that selection and focus are not indicated.
   As far as customizing further how the table looks in the printout,
   developers can provide custom renderers or paint code that conditionalize
   on the value of JComponent.isPaintingForPrint().

(defn get-printable
  "Return a Printable for use in printing this JTable.

   This method is meant for those wishing to customize the default
   Printable implementation used by JTable's
   print methods. Developers wanting simply to print the table
   should use one of those methods directly.

   The Printable can be requested in one of two printing modes.
   In both modes, it spreads table rows naturally in sequence across
   multiple pages, fitting as many rows as possible per page.
   PrintMode.NORMAL specifies that the table be
   printed at its current size. In this mode, there may be a need to spread
   columns across pages in a similar manner to that of the rows. When the
   need arises, columns are distributed in an order consistent with the
   table's ComponentOrientation.
   PrintMode.FIT_WIDTH specifies that the output be
   scaled smaller, if necessary, to fit the table's entire width
   (and thereby all columns) on each page. Width and height are scaled
   equally, maintaining the aspect ratio of the output.

   The Printable heads the portion of table on each page
   with the appropriate section from the table's JTableHeader,
   if it has one.

   Header and footer text can be added to the output by providing
   MessageFormat arguments. The printing code requests
   Strings from the formats, providing a single item which may be included
   in the formatted string: an Integer representing the current
   page number.

   You are encouraged to read the documentation for
   MessageFormat as some characters, such as single-quote,
   are special and need to be escaped.

   Here's an example of creating a MessageFormat that can be
   used to print `Duke's Table: Page - ` and the current page number:



       // notice the escaping of the single quote
       // notice how the page number is included with `{0}`
       MessageFormat format = new MessageFormat(`Duke''s Table: Page - {0}`);

   The Printable constrains what it draws to the printable
   area of each page that it prints. Under certain circumstances, it may
   find it impossible to fit all of a page's content into that area. In
   these cases the output may be clipped, but the implementation
   makes an effort to do something reasonable. Here are a few situations
   where this is known to occur, and how they may be handled by this
   particular implementation:

     In any mode, when the header or footer text is too wide to fit
         completely in the printable area -- print as much of the text as
         possible starting from the beginning, as determined by the table's
         ComponentOrientation.
     In any mode, when a row is too tall to fit in the
         printable area -- print the upper-most portion of the row
         and paint no lower border on the table.
     In PrintMode.NORMAL when a column
         is too wide to fit in the printable area -- print the center
         portion of the column and leave the left and right borders
         off the table.


   It is entirely valid for this Printable to be wrapped
   inside another in order to create complex reports and documents. You may
   even request that different pages be rendered into different sized
   printable areas. The implementation must be prepared to handle this
   (possibly by doing its layout calculations on the fly). However,
   providing different heights to each page will likely not work well
   with PrintMode.NORMAL when it has to spread columns
   across pages.

   As far as customizing how the table looks in the printed result,
   JTable itself will take care of hiding the selection
   and focus during printing. For additional customizations, your
   renderers or painting code can customize the look based on the value
   of JComponent.isPaintingForPrint()

   Also, before calling this method you may wish to first
   modify the state of the table, such as to cancel cell editing or
   have the user size the table appropriately. However, you must not
   modify the state of the table after this Printable
   has been fetched (invalid modifications include changes in size or
   underlying data). The behavior of the returned Printable
   is undefined once the table has been changed.
