(ns javax.swing.RowSorter
  "RowSorter provides the basis for sorting and filtering.
  Beyond creating and installing a RowSorter, you very rarely
  need to interact with one directly.  Refer to
  TableRowSorter for a concrete
  implementation of RowSorter for JTable.

  RowSorter's primary role is to provide a mapping between
  two coordinate systems: that of the view (for example a
  JTable) and that of the underlying data source, typically a
  model.

  The view invokes the following methods on the RowSorter:

  toggleSortOrder 혰 The view invokes this when the
      appropriate user gesture has occurred to trigger a sort.  For example,
      the user clicked a column header in a table.
  One of the model change methods 혰 The view invokes a model
      change method when the underlying model
      has changed.  There may be order dependencies in how the events are
      delivered, so a RowSorter should not update its mapping
      until one of these methods is invoked.

  Because the view makes extensive use of  the
  convertRowIndexToModel,
  convertRowIndexToView and getViewRowCount methods,
  these methods need to be fast.

  RowSorter provides notification of changes by way of
  RowSorterListener.  Two types of notification are sent:

  RowSorterEvent.Type.SORT_ORDER_CHANGED 혰 notifies
      listeners that the sort order has changed.  This is typically followed
      by a notification that the sort has changed.
  RowSorterEvent.Type.SORTED 혰 notifies listeners that
      the mapping maintained by the RowSorter has changed in
      some way.

  RowSorter implementations typically don't have a one-to-one
  mapping with the underlying model, but they can.
  For example, if a database does the sorting,
  toggleSortOrder might call through to the database
  (on a background thread), and override the mapping methods to return the
  argument that is passed in.

  Concrete implementations of RowSorter
  need to reference a model such as TableModel or
  ListModel.  The view classes, such as
  JTable and JList, will also have a
  reference to the model.  To avoid ordering dependencies,
  RowSorter implementations should not install a
  listener on the model.  Instead the view class will call into the
  RowSorter when the model changes.  For
  example, if a row is updated in a TableModel
  JTable invokes rowsUpdated.
  When the model changes, the view may call into any of the following methods:
  modelStructureChanged, allRowsChanged,
  rowsInserted, rowsDeleted and
  rowsUpdated."
