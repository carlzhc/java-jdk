(ns javax.swing.JSpinner
  "A single line input field that lets the user select a
  number or an object value from an ordered sequence. Spinners typically
  provide a pair of tiny arrow buttons for stepping through the elements
  of the sequence. The keyboard up/down arrow keys also cycle through the
  elements. The user may also be allowed to type a (legal) value directly
  into the spinner. Although combo boxes provide similar functionality,
  spinners are sometimes preferred because they don't require a drop down list
  that can obscure important data.

  A JSpinner's sequence value is defined by its
  SpinnerModel.
  The model can be specified as a constructor argument and
  changed with the model property.  SpinnerModel
  classes for some common types are provided: SpinnerListModel,
  SpinnerNumberModel, and SpinnerDateModel.

  A JSpinner has a single child component that's
  responsible for displaying
  and potentially changing the current element or value of
  the model, which is called the editor.  The editor is created
  by the JSpinner's constructor and can be changed with the
  editor property.  The JSpinner's editor stays
  in sync with the model by listening for ChangeEvents. If the
  user has changed the value displayed by the editor it is
  possible for the model's value to differ from that of
  the editor. To make sure the model has the same
  value as the editor use the commitEdit method, eg:


    try {
        spinner.commitEdit();
    }
    catch (ParseException pe) {
        // Edited value is invalid, spinner.getValue() will return
        // the last valid value, you could revert the spinner to show that:
        JComponent editor = spinner.getEditor();
        if (editor instanceof DefaultEditor) {
            ((DefaultEditor)editor).getTextField().setValue(spinner.getValue());
        }
        // reset the value to some known value:
        spinner.setValue(fallbackValue);
        // or treat the last valid value as the current, in which
        // case you don't need to do anything.
    }
    return spinner.getValue();

  How to Use Spinners,
