(ns javax.swing.JPasswordField
  "JPasswordField is a lightweight component that allows
  the editing of a single line of text where the view indicates
  something was typed, but does not show the original characters.
  You can find further information and examples in
  How to Use Text Fields,
  a section in The Java Tutorial.

  JPasswordField is intended
  to be source-compatible with java.awt.TextField
  used with echoChar set.  It is provided separately
  to make it easier to safely change the UI for the
  JTextField without affecting password entries.

  NOTE:
  By default, JPasswordField disables input methods; otherwise, input
  characters could be visible while they were composed using input methods.
  If an application needs the input methods support, please use the
  inherited method, enableInputMethods(true).

  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
  information see Swing's Threading
  Policy.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."

  Constructs a new JPasswordField that uses the
