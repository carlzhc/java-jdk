(ns javax.swing.Timer
  "Fires one or more ActionEvents at specified
  intervals. An example use is an animation object that uses a
  Timer as the trigger for drawing its frames.

  Setting up a timer
  involves creating a Timer object,
  registering one or more action listeners on it,
  and starting the timer using
  the start method.
  For example,
  the following code creates and starts a timer
  that fires an action event once per second
  (as specified by the first argument to the Timer constructor).
  The second argument to the Timer constructor
  specifies a listener to receive the timer's action events.



   int delay = 1000; //milliseconds
   ActionListener taskPerformer = new ActionListener() {
       public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
           //...Perform a task...
       }
   };
   new Timer(delay, taskPerformer).start();


  Timers are constructed by specifying both a delay parameter
  and an ActionListener. The delay parameter is used
  to set both the initial delay and the delay between event
  firing, in milliseconds. Once the timer has been started,
  it waits for the initial delay before firing its
  first ActionEvent to registered listeners.
  After this first event, it continues to fire events
  every time the between-event delay has elapsed, until it
  is stopped.

  After construction, the initial delay and the between-event
  delay can be changed independently, and additional
  ActionListeners may be added.

  If you want the timer to fire only the first time and then stop,
  invoke setRepeats(false) on the timer.

  Although all Timers perform their waiting
  using a single, shared thread
  (created by the first Timer object that executes),
  the action event handlers for Timers
  execute on another thread -- the event-dispatching thread.
  This means that the action handlers for Timers
  can safely perform operations on Swing components.
  However, it also means that the handlers must execute quickly
  to keep the GUI responsive.


  In v 1.3, another Timer class was added
  to the Java platform: java.util.Timer.
  Both it and javax.swing.Timer
  provide the same basic functionality,
  but java.util.Timer
  is more general and has more features.
  The javax.swing.Timer has two features
  that can make it a little easier to use with GUIs.
  First, its event handling metaphor is familiar to GUI programmers
  and can make dealing with the event-dispatching thread
  a bit simpler.
  Second, its
  automatic thread sharing means that you don't have to
  take special steps to avoid spawning
  too many threads.
  Instead, your timer uses the same thread
  used to make cursors blink,
  tool tips appear,
  and so on.

  and several examples of using timers by visiting

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
