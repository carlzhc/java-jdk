(ns javax.swing.ViewportLayout
  "The default layout manager for JViewport.
  ViewportLayout defines
  a policy for layout that should be useful for most applications.
  The viewport makes its view the same size as the viewport,
  however it will not make the view smaller than its minimum size.
  As the viewport grows the view is kept bottom justified until
  the entire view is visible, subsequently the view is kept top
  justified.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."
