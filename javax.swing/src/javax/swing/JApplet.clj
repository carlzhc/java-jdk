(ns javax.swing.JApplet
  "An extended version of java.applet.Applet that adds support for
  the JFC/Swing component architecture.
  You can find task-oriented documentation about using JApplet
  in The Java Tutorial,
  in the section
  How to Make Applets.

  The JApplet class is slightly incompatible with
  java.applet.Applet.  JApplet contains a
  JRootPane as its only child.  The contentPane
  should be the parent of any children of the JApplet.
  As a convenience, the add, remove, and setLayout
  methods of this class are overridden, so that they delegate calls
  to the corresponding methods of the ContentPane.
  For example, you can add a child component to an applet as follows:


        applet.add(child);

  And the child will be added to the contentPane.
  The contentPane will always be non-null.
  Attempting to set it to null will cause the
  JApplet to throw an exception. The default
  contentPane will have a BorderLayout
  manager set on it.
  Refer to RootPaneContainer
  for details on adding, removing and setting the LayoutManager
  of a JApplet.

  Please see the JRootPane documentation for a
  complete description of the contentPane, glassPane,
  and layeredPane properties.

  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
  information see Swing's Threading
  Policy.

  Warning:
  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
  has been added to the java.beans package.
  Please see XMLEncoder."

   null or not a user-set drop target, this method will change the
   drop target as follows: If newHandler is null it will
   clear the drop target. If not null it will install a new
   DropTarget.

   Note: When used with JApplet, TransferHandler only
   provides data import capability, as the data export related methods
   are currently typed to JComponent.
